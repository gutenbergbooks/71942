<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">A child’s</span> reading book, it seems to me,
should secure for the child three things,—practice
in the art of reading, amusement,
and instruction. Whether my little book is
fitted to attain this threefold object, others
must decide; but in laying it before the public,
let me urge careful attention to a few suggestions.</p>

<p>1. As the book is arranged so as to begin
with the opening of the school year and to follow it to its close,
the interest of pupils will be increased by reading the different
chapters during the seasons to which they refer.</p>

<p>2. The teacher should exercise judgment as to the omission of
any chapter or group of chapters which may seem beyond the
comprehension of the class. With a little care, such an omission
may nearly always be made without injury to the usefulness of the
rest of the book.</p>

<p>3. Specimens of the objects described, when these can be found
in the locality, should always be on exhibition in the schoolroom.
Whenever possible, the children themselves should collect and
handle these specimens. If for any reason this collection by the
children cannot be accomplished, the teacher should not fail to
anticipate the readings, and to provide the objects mentioned.</p>

<p>By the observance of these simple and practicable suggestions, it
is believed that, while the children are being trained in the art of
reading, their powers of observation and of reasoning will be developed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
and that they will be inspired with a lifelong interest in
nature. The child’s mind is peculiarly alive to the charm of nature
when she is studied in detail, and through her it can be trained to
observe accurately and to reason logically.</p>

<p>Through the neglect of nature study, the wits of the country child
lose just the sharpening they most need, to say nothing of a stimulus
and delight which can ill be spared by one whose mental life is
apt to be monotonous.</p>

<p>The wits of the city child may secure in other ways the sharpening
so essential to success in life; yet the training afforded by a logical
study of plants, and the pleasure which such a study, rightly
directed, is sure to yield, are as invaluable to him as to his country
cousin.</p>

<p>Experience having proved to my keenest satisfaction that almost
invariably children can be interested in stories of plants and <em>their</em>
children, to the children of the land I offer this little book, in the
earnest hope that its pages may lead at least some few of them to
find in life a new joy and a deeper meaning.</p>

<p>The aid derived from many sources in the preparation of “Plants
and their Children” is heartily acknowledged; but more especially
I wish to extend my thanks to Messrs. Holt &amp; Co. for their courtesy
in allowing the reproduction of several cuts from their valuable and
interesting publication, “The Natural History of Plants,” translated
from the German of Kerner von Marilaun.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="IN_THE_ORCHARD">IN THE ORCHARD</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Is</span> there a nicer place in
which to play than an
old apple orchard? Once under those favorite trees
whose branches sweep the ground, you are quite shut
off from the great, troublesome, outside world. And
how happy and safe you feel in that green world of
your own!—a world just made for children, a world
of grass and leaves and birds and flowers, where lessons
and grown-up people alike have no part.</p>

<p>In the lightly swinging branches you find prancing
horses, and on many a mad ride they carry you. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
larger ones are steep paths leading up mountain sides.
Great chasms yawn beneath you. Here only the daring,
the cool-headed, may hope to be successful and
reach the highest points without danger to their bones.</p>

<p>Out here the girls bring their dolls, and play house.
Nothing can make a more interesting or a more surprising
house than an apple tree, its rooms are so many and
of such curious shapes. Then, too, the seats in these
rooms are far more comfortable than the chairs used
by ordinary people in everyday houses. The doings of
the Robin family are overlooked by its windows. One
is amazed to see how many fat worms Mother Robin
manages to pop down the yawning baby throats, and
wonders how baby robins ever live to grow up.</p>

<p>From these windows you watch the first flying lesson;
and you laugh to see the little cowards cling to the
branch close by, paying little heed to their parents’
noisy indignation. All the same, you wish that you
too might suddenly grow a pair of wings, and join the
little class, and learn to do the one thing that seems
even more delightful than tree climbing.</p>

<p>That you children long to be out of the schoolroom
this minute, out in the orchard so full of possibilities, I
do not wonder a bit. But as the big people have
decided that from now on for some months you must
spend much of your time with lesson books, I have a
plan to propose.</p>

<p>What do you say to trying to bring something of the
outdoor places that we love into the schoolroom, which
we do not love as much as we should if lessons were
always taught in the right way?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>Now let us pretend—and even grown-up people, who
can do difficult sums, and answer questions in history
and geography better than children, cannot “pretend”
one half so well—now let us pretend that we are about
to spend the morning in the orchard.</p>

<p>Here we go, out of the schoolroom into the air and
sunshine, along the road, up the hill, till we reach the
stone wall beyond which lies our orchard.</p>

<p>Ah! it is good to get into the cool of the dear, friendly
trees. And just now, more than ever, they seem friendly
to you boys and girls; for they are heavy with apples,—beautiful
red and golden apples, that tempt you to
clamber up into the green sea of leaves above.</p>

<p>Now let us “pretend” that you have had your fill,
and are ready to gather quietly about me
on the long grass. But first, please, one
of you bring me an apple. Let it be well-grown
and rounded, with a rosy, sun-burned
cheek; for, as we are to spend
some little time with this apple, the more
perfect it is in shape, the richer in color,
the sounder all the way through, the better.
It is good to be as much as possible with
things that are beautiful and wholesome and hearty,
even though they are only apples.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp25" id="011" style="max-width: 33.5625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/011.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Here we have (Fig. <a href="#011">1</a>) a fine specimen. What do
you know, any of you, about this apple? Perhaps this
seems a strange question. But when we see something
that is fine and beautiful, is it strange that we wish to
know its history? If I see a man or a woman who
seems to me all that a man or woman should be; if he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
or she is fine-looking and fine-acting, straight and strong,
and beautiful and kind, and brave and generous,—I
ask, “Who is he? Where does she come from? What
have they done?”</p>

<p>Of course, a fine apple is not so interesting as a fine
man or woman, or as a fine boy or girl. Still there is
much of interest to learn even about an apple.</p>

<p>None of you seems anxious to tell the apple’s story,
so I shall have to start you with some questions.</p>

<p>Do you remember playing in this same orchard last
spring?</p>

<p>Yes, you have not forgotten those Saturdays in May.
The trees were all pink and white with apple blossoms.
The air was sweet with fragrance, and full of the voices
of birds, and of bees that were bustling about from
flower to flower. No, indeed! you have not forgotten
those happy mornings. What is more, you never will.
They are among the things that will stay by you, and
be a rest and help to you all your lives. I wish there
were no child living that might not carry with him
always the memory of May days in an apple orchard.</p>

<p>How has it come about, do you suppose, that these
trees which in May were covered with flowers are now
heavy with apples?</p>

<p>Can any of you children answer this riddle? How
have these great apples managed to take the place of
the delicate apple blossoms?</p>

<p>There are some children who keep their eyes open,
and really see what is going on about them, instead of
acting as if they were quite blind; and perhaps some
such child will say, “Oh, yes! I know how it happened.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
I have seen it all,” and will be able to tell the whole
story at once.</p>

<p>I should like very much to meet that boy or girl,
and I should like to take a country walk with him or
her; for there are so few children, or grown people
either, who use both their eyes to see with, and the
brain which lies back of their eyes to think and question
with, that it is a rare treat to meet and to go about with
one of them.</p>

<p>But I should be almost as much pleased to meet the
child who says, “Well, I know that first the blossoms
come. Early in May they make the orchard so nice
to play in. But in a few days they begin to fall.
Their little white leaves come dropping down like
snowflakes; and soon after, if you climb out along
the branches and look close, where there was a
blossom before, you find now a little green thing
something like a knob (Fig. <a href="#013">2</a>). This tiny knob
keeps growing bigger and bigger, and then you see
that it is a baby apple. As the weeks go by, the little
apple grows into a big one; and at last the green begins
to fade away, and the red and yellow to come. One day
you find the great grown apple all ripe, and ready to
eat. But I never could see just what made it come like
that, such a big, heavy apple from such a little flower,
and I always wondered about it.”</p>

<figure class="figright illowp15" id="013" style="max-width: 11.8125em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 2</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Now, if we wonder about the things we see, we are
on the right road. The child who first “sees” what is
happening around him, and then “wonders” and asks
questions, is sure to be good company to other people
and to himself. (And as one spends more time with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
himself than with any one else, he is lucky if he finds
himself a pleasant companion.) Such a child has not
lost the use of his eyes, as so many of us seem to have
done. And when the little brain is full of questions, it
bids fair to become a big brain, which may answer some
day the questions the world is asking.</p>

<p>Before I tell you just how the big apple managed to
take the place of the pretty, delicate flower, let us take
a good look at this flower.</p>

<p>But in September apple flowers are not to be had
for the asking. Not one is to be found on all these
trees. So just now we must use the
picture instead. And when May comes,
your teacher will bring you a branch
bearing the beautiful blossoms; or, better
still, perhaps she will take you out
into the orchard itself, and you can go
over this chapter again with the lovely
living flowers before you.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Now, as you look at this picture of the apple flower
(Fig. <a href="#014">3</a>), you see a circle made up of five pretty leaves.
Sometimes these are white; again they are pink. And
in the center what do you see? Why, there you see a
quantity of odd-looking little things whose names you
do not know. They look somewhat like small, rather
crooked pins; for on the tips of most of them are
objects which remind you of the head of a pin.</p>

<p>If you were looking at a real flower, you would see
that these pin heads were little boxes filled with a
yellow dust which comes off upon one’s fingers; and
so for the present we will call them “dust boxes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p>But besides these pins—later we shall learn their
real names—besides these pins with dust boxes, we
find some others which are without any such boxes.
The shape of these reminds us a little of the pegs or
pins we use in the game of tenpins. If we looked at
them very closely, we should see that there were five
of them, but that these five were joined below
into one piece.</p>

<p>Now suppose we take the apple blossom
and pull off all its pretty white flower leaves,
and all the pins with dust boxes, what will be
left?</p>

<figure class="figright illowp20" id="015" style="max-width: 25.4375em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 4</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This picture (Fig. <a href="#015">4</a>) shows you just what
is left. You see what looks like a little cup
or vase. The upper part of this is cut into
five pieces, which are rolled back. In the picture one
of these pieces is almost out of sight. In the real
blossom these pieces look like little green leaves. And
set into this cup is the lower, united part of those pins
which have no dust boxes on top.</p>

<p>I fancy that you are better acquainted with the apple
blossom than ever before, never mind how many mornings
you may have spent in the sweet-smelling, pink
and white orchard. You know just what goes to make
up each separate flower, for all the many hundreds of
blossoms are made on the one plan.</p>

<p>And only now are you ready to hear what happened
to make the apple take the place of the blossom.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="THE_STORY_OF_THE_BEE">THE STORY OF THE BEE</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">This</span> is what happened. And it is a
true story.</p>

<p>One morning last May a bee set out among the
flowers on a honey hunt.</p>

<p>Perhaps it would be more true to say that the bee
set out to hunt for the sweet stuff of which honey is
made; for while this sweet stuff is still in the flower
cup it is not honey, any more than the wheat growing
in the field is bread. The wheat becomes bread later,
after it has been cut and gathered and threshed and
ground, and brought into the kitchen and there changed
into bread; and the sweet stuff becomes honey only
after the bees have carried it home and worked it.</p>

<p>As the bee left home this particular morning, it made
up its mind that it would devote itself to the apple
blossoms; for did you know that when a bee goes
flower visiting, usually it gives all its attention to one
kind of flower till it has finished that special round
of visits?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span></p>

<p>So off the bee flew; and in a few moments it saw
hundreds of little pink and white handkerchiefs waving
at it from the apple orchard.</p>

<p>What do you suppose these were, these gay little
handkerchiefs? They were the flower leaves of the
apple blossoms. I call them handkerchiefs, because,
just as boys and girls sometimes wave their handkerchiefs
when they wish to signal other boys and girls,
so the apple tree uses its gay flower leaves to attract
the attention of the bee, and persuade it to visit the
flowers. Of course, really, they are not handkerchiefs
at all. They would hardly be large enough for any but
fairy noses, would they?</p>

<p>When the bee saw so many bright handkerchiefs
waving it welcome, along it hurried; for it knew this
was a signal that material for honey making was at
hand. Another minute, and it had settled upon a
freshly opened flower, and was eagerly stealing the
precious sweet.</p>

<p>You children know, that, when you are given permission
to go to the closet for a piece of candy or cake,
you are not apt to set about it very gently. You are in
too much of a hurry for that. Often you come very
near knocking everything over, in your haste to get
hold of what you want.</p>

<p>And bees are quite as greedy as any boy or girl could
be. So our friend dived right into the pretty flower,
brushing rudely against the little dust boxes. These,
being full to overflowing with golden dust, spilled their
contents, and powdered the bee quite yellow.</p>

<p>Having made sure that nothing more was to be found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
just there, off flew the dusty bee to the next blossom.
Into this it pushed its way, and in so doing struck
those pins which have no dust boxes; and upon their
broad, flat tips fell some of the yellow dust grains with
which its body was powdered.</p>

<p>Now there began to happen a strange thing.</p>

<p>But before I tell you more, I must stop one moment
to remind you that these pins without dust boxes are
joined below into one piece, and that this piece is set
deep into the green cup which holds the rest of the
flower (see Fig. <a href="#015">4</a>); and I must tell you, that, if you
should cut open this cup, you would find a number of
little round objects looking like tiny green eggs.</p>

<p>The strange thing that began to happen was this:—</p>

<p>Soon after the yellow dust from the bee fell upon
the flat tips of the pins without dust boxes, the little
green objects deep within the green cup became full
of life, and began to get larger. And not only this:
the green cup also seemed to feel this new life; for it
too grew bigger and bigger, and juicier and juicier,
until it became the fine juicy apple we have before us
this morning.</p>

<p>So now you understand a little of what happened to
make the great apple take the place of the delicate
blossom.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="THE_APPLES_TREASURES">THE APPLE’S TREASURES</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">If</span> we lift our apple by its stem, it hangs in the same
position as when growing on the tree (Fig. <a href="#019-1">5</a>).</p>

<p>But the blossom whose place in the world is
taken by this apple held its little head
proudly in the air. So let us put the apple
in the same position, and see what is left
of the flower from which it has come
(Fig. <a href="#019-2">6</a>).</p>

<figure class="figright illowp20" id="019-1" style="max-width: 33.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/019-1.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 5</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We see the apple stem, which last May
was the flower stem. This has grown
thick and strong enough to hold the apple
fast to the tree till it ripens and is ready
to drop.</p>

<p>The upper part of the stem you cannot
see, because the apple has swelled downwards
all about it, or upwards we should
say, if it were still on the tree.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp20" id="019-2" style="max-width: 33.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/019-2.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 6</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>On the top of the apple, in a little
hollow, we see some crumpled things
which look like tiny withered leaves.</p>

<p>You remember that when the bee left the yellow
dust in the apple blossom, the green cup began to
grow big and juicy, and to turn into the apple. And
these little crumpled things are all that is left of the
five green leaves into which the upper part of the cup
was divided. These little leaves have been out in all
kinds of weather for many weeks, so no wonder they
look rather mussy and forlorn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>It is hard to realize that from the center of this
now crumpled bunch grew the pretty apple blossom.</p>

<p>Now where are those tiny round things
that were packed away inside the green
cup?</p>

<p>Well, as that cup is now this apple, the
chances are that they are still hidden safely
away within it. So let us take a knife and
cut the apple open.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp20" id="020-1" style="max-width: 33em;">

<p>What do you find in its very heart? If you cut it
through crosswise, you find five brown seeds packed as
neatly as jewels in their case (Fig. <a href="#020-1">7</a>); and
if you cut it through lengthwise, you discover
only two or three seeds (Fig. <a href="#020-2">8</a>).</p>

<p>Probably I need not say to you that
these seeds were once the little round
things hidden within the green cup.</p>

more about the wonderful golden dust
which turns flowers into apples as easily

about something else.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="WHAT_A_PLANT_LIVES">WHAT A PLANT LIVES
FOR</h3>
</div>

<figure class="figleft illowp49" id="021" style="max-width: 41.0625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/021.jpg" alt="Grass">
</figure>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">When</span> you go for a walk in the
country, what do you see all about
you?</p>

<p>“Cows and horses, and chickens and
birds, and trees and flowers,”
answers some child.</p>

<p>Yes, all of these things you
see. But of the trees and plants
you see even more than of the
horses and cows and birds. On
every side are plants of one kind
or another. The fields are full of
grass plants. The woods are full of tree
plants. Along the roadside are plants of
many varieties.</p>

<p>Now, what are all these plants trying
to do? “To grow,” comes the answer.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
To grow big and strong enough to hold their own in
the world. That is just what they are trying to do.</p>

<p>Then, too, they are trying to flower.</p>

<p>“But they don’t all have flowers,” objects one voice.</p>

<p>You are right. They do not all have flowers; but
you would be surprised to know how many of them
do. In fact, all of them except the ferns and mosses,
and a few others, some of which you would hardly
recognize as plants,—all of them, with these exceptions,
flower at some time in their lives.</p>

<p>All the trees have flowers, and all the grasses (Figs.
<a href="#022">9</a>, <a href="#023">10</a>); and all those plants which get so dusty along
the roadside, and which you call “weeds,”—each
one of these has its own flower. This may be so
small and dull-looking that you have never noticed
it; and unless you look sharply, perhaps you
never will. But all the same, it is a flower.</p>

<p>But there is one especial thing which is really
the object of the plant’s life. Now, who can tell
me this: what is this object of a plant’s life?</p>

<p>Do you know just what I mean by this question?
I doubt it; but I will try to make it clear
to you.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp10" id="022" style="max-width: 13.9375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/022.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 9</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>If I see a boy stop his play, get his hat, and start
down the street, I know that he has what we call “an
object in view.” There is some reason for what he is
doing. And if I say to him, “What is the <em>object</em> of your
walk?” I mean, “For what are you going down the
street?” And if he answers, “I am going to get a
pound of tea for my mother,” I know that a pound of
tea is the <em>object</em> of his walk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p>So when I ask what is the <em>object</em> of a plant’s life, I
mean why does a plant send out roots in search of food,
and a stem to carry this food upward, and
leaves to drink in air and sunshine? What
is the object of all this?</p>

<p>A great many people seem to think that
the object of all plants with pretty flowers
must be to give pleasure. But these people
quite forget that hundreds and thousands of
flowers live and die far away in the lonely
forest, where no human eye ever sees them;
that they so lived and died hundreds and
thousands of years before there were any
men and women, and boys and girls, upon
the earth. And so, if they stopped long
enough quietly to think about it, they would
see for themselves that plants must have
some other object in life than to give people pleasure.</p>

<p>But now let us go back to the tree from which we
took this apple, and see if we can find out its special
object.</p>

<p>“Why, apples!” some of you exclaim. “Surely the
object of an apple tree is to bear apples.”</p>

<p>That is it exactly. An apple tree lives to bear apples.</p>

<p>And now why is an apple such an important thing?
Why is it worth so much time and trouble? What is
its use?</p>

<p>“It is good to eat,” chime all the children in chorus.</p>

<p>Yes, so it is; but then, you must remember that once
upon a time, apple trees, like all other plants and trees,
grew in lonely places where there were no boys and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
girls to eat their fruit. So we must find some other
answer.</p>

<p>Think for a moment, and then tell me what you find
inside every apple.</p>

<p>“Apple seeds,” one of you replies.</p>

<p>And what is the use of these apple seeds?</p>

<p>“Why, they make new apple trees!”</p>

<p>If this be so, if every apple holds some little seeds
from which new apple trees may grow, does it not look
as though an apple were useful and important because
it yields seeds?</p>

<p>And what is true of the apple tree is true of other
plants and trees. The plant lives to bear fruit. The
fruit is that part of the plant which holds its seeds;
and it is of importance for just this reason, that it holds
the seeds from which come new plants.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">We</span> have just learned that the fruit is important
because it holds the plant’s seeds; and we know
that seeds are important because from them come the
new plants for another year. Let us stop here one
moment, and try to think what would happen if plants
should stop having seeds, if there should be no new
plants.</p>

<p>We all, and especially those of us who are children,
carry about with us a little picture gallery of our very
own. In this gallery are pictures of things which our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
real eyes have never seen, yet which we ourselves see
quite as plainly as the objects which our eyes rest upon
in the outside world. Some of these pictures are very
beautiful. They show us things so wonderful and delightful
and interesting, that at times we forget all about
the real, outside things. Indeed, these pictures often
seem to us more real than anything else in the world.
And once in a great while we admire them so earnestly
that we are able to make them come true; that is, <em>we
turn our backs upon them</em>, and work so hard to bring
them about, that at last what was only a picture becomes
a reality.</p>

<p>Perhaps some of you children can step into this little
gallery of your own, and see a picture of the great
world as it would be if there should be no new plants.</p>

<p>This picture would show the world some hundreds of
years from now; for, although some plants live only a
short time, others (and usually these are trees) live hundreds
of years.</p>

<p>But in the picture even the last tree has died away.
Upon the earth there is not one green, growing thing.
The sun beats down upon the bare, brown deserts. It
seems to scorch and blister the rocky mountain sides.
There are no cool shadows where one can lie on a
summer afternoon; no dark, ferny nooks, such as
children love, down by the stream. But, after all, that
does not matter much, for there are no children to
search out such hidden, secret spots.</p>

<p>“No children! Why, what has happened to them?”</p>

<p>Well, if <em>plants</em> should stop having children (for the
little young plants that come up each year are just the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
children of the big, grown-up plants), all other life—the
life of all grown people, and of all children, and of
all animals—would also come to an end.</p>

<p>Did you ever stop to think of this,—that your very
life depended upon these plants and trees? You know
that they are pretty to look at, and pleasant to play
about; but I doubt if you ever realized before, that to
them you owe your life.</p>

<p>Now let us see how this can be. What did you have
this morning for breakfast?</p>

<p>Bread and milk? Well, of what is the bread made?
Flour? Yes, and the flour is made from the seeds of
the wheat. If the wheat stopped having seeds, you
would stop having bread made from wheat seeds. That
is plain enough.</p>

<p>Then the milk,—where does that come from?</p>

<p>“That comes from the cows, and cows are not
plants,” you say.</p>

<p>True, cows are not plants, but what would happen to
the cows if there were no plants? Do not cows live in
the green meadows, where all day long they munch the
grass plants? And would there be any green meadows
and all-day banquets, in years to come, if the grass did
not first flower, and then seed? So then, no grass, no
cows, and you would be without milk as well as without
bread for breakfast.</p>

<p>And so it is with all the rest of our food. We live on
either plants or animals. If there were no plants, there
would be no animals, for animals cannot live without
plants.</p>

<p>It is something like the house that Jack built, isn’t it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p>“We are the children that drink the milk, that comes
from the cows, that eat the grass, that grows from the
seeds in the meadow.”</p>

<p>“If there were no seeds, there would be no grass to
feed the cows that give us our milk for breakfast.”</p>

<p>And so it is everywhere. Plants give us a kind of
food that we must have, and that only they can give.
They could get on well enough without animals. Indeed,
for a long time they did so, many hundreds of
years ago. But animals cannot live without plants.</p>

<p>I think you will now remember why seeds are of
such great importance.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="HOW_THE_APPLE_SHIELDS_ITS_YOUNG">HOW THE APPLE SHIELDS ITS YOUNG</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Some</span> time ago you noticed that apple seeds were
packed away within the apple as neatly as though
they were precious jewels in their case.</p>

<p>When we see something done up very carefully, surrounded
with cotton wool, laid in a beautiful
box, and wrapped about with soft
paper, we feel sure that the object of all
this care is of value. Even the outside of
such a package tells us that something
precious lies within.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp20" id="027" style="max-width: 32.8125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/027.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 11</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But what precious jewels could be laid
away more carefully than these apple
seeds? And what jewel case could boast
a more beautiful outside than this red-cheeked apple
(Fig. <a href="#027">11</a>)?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p>Pass it around. Note its lovely color, its delicate
markings, its satin-like skin. For myself, I feel sure
that I never have seen a jewel case one
half so beautiful.</p>

<p>Then cut it open and see how carefully
the soft yet firm apple flesh is packed
about the little seeds, keeping them safe
from harm (Fig. <a href="#028">12</a>).</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp20" id="028" style="max-width: 32.9375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/028.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 12</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But perhaps you think that anything so
good to eat is not of much use as a protection. It
takes you boys and girls about half a minute to swallow
such a jewel case as this.</p>

<p>But here comes the interesting part of the story.</p>

<p>When you learn how well able this apple is to defend
from harm its precious seeds, I think you will look upon
it with new respect, and will own that it is not only a
beautiful jewel case, but a safe one.</p>

<p>All seeds need care and wrapping-up till they are
ripe; for if they fall to the ground before they are well
grown, they will not be able to start new plants.</p>

<p>You know that you can tell whether an apple is ripe
by looking at its seeds, for the fruit and its seeds ripen
together. When the apple seeds are dark brown, then
the apple is ready to be eaten.</p>

<p>But if, in order to find out whether an apple was ripe,
you were obliged always to examine its seeds, you might
destroy many apples and waste many young seeds before
you found what you wished; so, in order to protect
its young, the apple must tell you when it is ready to
be eaten in some other way than by its seeds.</p>

<p>How does it do this? Why, it puts off its green coat,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
and instead wears one of red or yellow; and from being
hard to the touch, it becomes soft and yielding when
you press it with your fingers. If not picked, then it
falls upon the ground in order to show you that it is waiting
for you; and when you bite into it, you find it juicy,
and pleasant to the taste.</p>

<p>While eating such an apple as this, you can be sure
that when you come to the inner part, which holds its
seeds, you will find these brown, and ripe, and quite
ready to be set free from the case which has held them
so carefully all summer.</p>

<p>But how does the apple still further protect its young
till they are ready to go out into the world?</p>

<p>Well, stop and think what happened one day last
summer when you stole into the orchard and ate a
quantity of green apples, the little seeds of which were
far too white and young to be sent off by themselves.</p>

<p>In the first place, as soon as you began to climb
the tree, had you chosen to stop and listen, you could
almost have heard the green skins of those apples calling
out to you, “Don’t eat us, we’re not ripe yet!”</p>

<p>And when you felt them with your fingers, they were
hard to the touch; and this hardness said to you, “Don’t
eat us, we’re not ripe yet!”</p>

<p>But all the same, you ate them; and the sour taste
which puckered up your mouth said to you, “Stop eating
us, we’re not ripe yet!”</p>

<p>But you did not pay any attention to their warnings;
and, though they spared no pains, those apples were
not able to save their baby seeds from being wasted by
your greediness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>But there was still one thing they could do to prevent
your eating many more green apples, and wasting more
half-ripe seeds. They could punish you so severely for
having disobeyed their warnings, that you would not be
likely very soon to do the same thing again.</p>

<p>And this is just what they did.</p>

<p>When feeling so ill and unhappy that summer night
from all the unripe fruit you had been eating, perhaps
you hardly realized that those apples were crying out to
you,—</p>

<p>“You would not listen to us, and so we are punishing
you by making you ill and uncomfortable. When you
saw how green we were, we were begging you not to
eat us till our young seeds were ripe. When you felt
how hard we were, we were trying to make you understand
that we were not ready for you yet. And, now
that you <em>have</em> eaten us in spite of all that we did to save
ourselves and our seeds, we are going to make you just
as unhappy as we know how. Perhaps next time you
will pay some heed to our warnings, and will leave us
alone till we are ready to let our young ones go out into
the world.”</p>

<p>So after this when I show you an apple, and ask you
what you know about it, I fancy you will have quite a
story to tell,—a story that begins with one May day in
the orchard, when a bee went flower visiting, and ends
with the little brown seeds which you let fall upon the
ground, when you had finished eating the rosy cheeks
and juicy pulp of the apple seed case. And the apple’s
story is also the story of many other fruits.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="SOME">SOME COUSINS OF THE APPLE</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> pear (Fig. <a href="#031-2">13</a>) is a near cousin of the apple.</p>

<p>But perhaps you did not know that plants and
trees had cousins.</p>

<p>As you learn more and more about them, you will
begin to feel that in many ways plants are very much
like people.</p>

<p>Both the pear and the apple belong to the Rose
family. They are cousins to all the garden roses, as
well as to the lovely wild rose that you meet so often
in summer along the roadside.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp20" id="031-2" style="max-width: 28.5625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/031-2.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 13</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We know some families where the girls
and boys look so much alike that we could
guess they were brothers and sisters, even if
we did not know that they all lived in the
one house and had the one family name. If
we look carefully at the plants we meet, at
their leaves and flowers and fruits, and even
at their stems and roots, often we may guess
rightly which ones belong to the same family.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>If we place side by side an apple blossom and a pear
blossom, we see that they are very like each other.
Both have the green outside cup which above is cut
into five little green leaves. Both have five white or
pinkish flower leaves. Both have a good many pins
with dust boxes, and from two to five of those pins
without dust boxes.</p>

<p>If we place side by side a pear and an apple, we
see in both cases that it is the green cup, grown
big and juicy and ripe, which forms the delicious
fruit.</p>

<p>If we cut these two fruits open lengthwise, we can
see just how the pins without dust boxes are set into
the green cup; and we can see that the lower, united
part of these pins makes a little box which holds the
seeds.</p>

<p>In the picture (Fig. <a href="#032">14</a>) the shading shows you where
this seedbox ends, and the green cup, or
what once was the green cup, begins. This
is rather hard to understand, I know; but
your teacher can make it clear to you with a
real pear.</p>

<p>So it ought to surprise you no longer to
learn that the apple and the pear are cousins.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp20" id="032" style="max-width: 27.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/032.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 14</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Now, I want you to look at the picture at
the head of this chapter. This is the wild
rose, the flower from which the great Rose
family takes its name.</p>

<p>This rose is a much larger flower than either the
apple or the pear blossom. Its flower leaves are deep
pink. These bright flower leaves make gay handkerchiefs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
for signaling when the rose plant wishes to
attract the attention of the bees.</p>

<p>But there are five of them, just as there are in the
apple and the pear blossom; and there are the pins
with dust boxes,—so many of them, in the rose, that it
would take some time to count them all. And in the
center are the pins which have seedboxes
below; for these pins in the rose are quite
separate one from another, and each one has
its own little seedbox.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp20" id="033-1" style="max-width: 22.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/033-1.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 15</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>So, though different in some ways, in others
the flower of the rose is very much like those
of the apple and the pear.</p>

<p>In this picture (Fig. <a href="#033-1">15</a>) you see its fruit.
This is called the “rose hip.” When ripe, it turns
bright red. In late summer you see the rosebushes
covered with these pretty hips. At times this fruit
does not look altogether unlike a tiny apple or pear;
but if we cut it open lengthwise, we see that its inside
arrangements are quite different.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp20" id="033-2" style="max-width: 24em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/033-2.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 16</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The lower parts of the pins without dust boxes do
not grow into one piece with the green cup
(now the red cup), as in the apple and the
pear. Instead, this cup (Fig. <a href="#033-2">16</a>) is hollow.
To its inner sides are fastened the little seedboxes,
as you will see if you look carefully
at the picture. This hollow case with its
separate seedboxes shows you that the rose
plant is not so closely related to the pear
and the apple trees as these trees are to each other.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Perhaps</span> one day you
bit into the fruit of the
rose, and found it sour and
unpleasant to the taste. You
may have forgotten that not
long ago you learned a new
meaning for the word “fruit.”
Possibly you still fancy that a
fruit must be something good
to eat. So many people have
this idea, that once more I wish to
make clear to you that <em>the fruit is the
seed-holding part of the plant</em>.</p>

<p>Whether this part is good to eat or not,
makes no difference as to its being a fruit.</p>

<p>The apple is a fruit, you remember, not because
it is good to eat, but because it holds
the seeds of the apple tree.</p>

<p>And for this same reason the pear is a fruit. It is
the case in which is laid the seedbox of the pear tree.
This case, when ripe, happens to be juicy and delicious;
but it would be quite as much a fruit if it were dry and
hard, and without taste.</p>

<p>And so the rose hip is a fruit, because it is the case
which holds the little seedboxes of the rose flower.</p>

<p>What is the fruit of the milkweed?</p>

<p>All country children know the milkweed plant, with
its big bright leaves, and bunches of pink or red or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
purple flowers (Fig. <a href="#035-1">17</a>). And you know the puffy
pods that later split
open, letting out a
mass of brown,
silky-tailed seeds.
There! I have
given the answer to my
own question; for if the
plant’s fruit is the seed-holding
part, then the milkweed’s
fruit must be this pod
stuffed full of beautiful, fairy-like
seeds.</p>

<p>Then you know the burdock (Fig. <a href="#035-2">18</a>)
which grows along the country road.
But perhaps you do not know that
the fruit of this is the prickly
burr which hooks itself to your clothes on
your way to school. This burr (Fig. <a href="#035-3">19</a>)
is the case which holds the little seeds
of the burdock, and so it must
be its fruit.</p>

<p>The fruit of the dandelion
is the silvery puffball (Fig.
<a href="#035-4">20</a>) or “clock,” by blowing at
which you try to tell the time of day.
If you pull off one of the feathery
objects which go to make up the
puffball, at its lower end you see a
little dandelion seedbox (Fig. <a href="#036-1">21</a>).</p>

<p>And these fall days, along the roadsides and in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
woods, everywhere you see fruits which you
will hardly know as such unless you keep in
mind the true meaning of the word.</p>

<p>Many of these I am sure you would not care
to eat. The burr from the burdock would
not make a pleasant mouthful. Neither
would you like to breakfast on a milkweed pod. And
a quantity of dandelion puffballs would hardly add to
the enjoyment of your supper.</p>

<p>If you should tell your mother you had brought her
some fruit, and should show her a basket of burrs and
pods, she would think you were only joking, and perhaps
a little foolish; and I dare say she would be
greatly surprised to find you were using the word quite
rightly.</p>

<p>Within this, in all of them, is
a hard object, which we call the
stone or pit; and inside this stone or
pit, in each case, lies the seed.</p>

<p>These next pictures show you two
views of the flower of the cherry (Figs.
<a href="#037-4">26</a>, <a href="#037-5">27</a>).</p>

<p>Here you see a likeness to other members
of the Rose family, to the blossoms
of the apple and the pear.</p>

<p>You see that the green cup is cut into
five little leaves (in the picture these are
turned back and downward).
You see also the
five white flower leaves, and ever so
many of the pins with dust boxes.
But you find only
one of those pins
without dust boxes;
and this, as you now
know, has a seedbox below.</p>

<p>Well, that is all right. The
cherry blossom has but one of these
pins, and the flowers of the peach
and of the plum have only one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<p>Figure <a href="#038">28</a> shows you a cherry blossom cut open.
Here you see plainly the single pin with a seedbox.</p>

<p>This seedbox with its case is what grows into the
cherry. The white flower leaves, and the pins with
dust boxes, fall away. In the cherry flower the green
cup also disappears, instead of making the best part of
the fruit, as it does with the apple and the pear. And
the upper part of the seedbox pin withers
off; but the seedbox below grows juicy and
ripe and red, at least its outer case does.</p>

<p>By the end of June you take out the long
ladder and place it against the cherry tree.
Seating yourself on one of its upper rungs,
you swallow the outside of the shining little ball we
call the cherry, letting the stony seedbox inside drop
down upon the ground, where all ripe seeds belong.</p>

<p>The story of the plum and of the peach is almost the
same as the story of the cherry. If you understand
how the single seedbox of the cherry blossom turns
into the cherry fruit, then you understand how the same
thing happens with the single seedboxes of the plum
and the peach blossom.</p>

<p>You know that in the flowers of the pear and the apple
there were several of these pins without dust boxes; and
although these were joined below into a single seedbox,
this had separate compartments for the many seeds.</p>

<p>But the single seedboxes of the cherry, the plum, and
the peach, have but one hollow. Usually in this hollow
we find only one seed. So you see that these three
fruits make a little group by themselves because of
their great likeness to one another.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Cherries</span> and plums we find
growing wild in the woods
and fields. While in many
ways the wild trees are
unlike those we grow in
our orchards, yet, if you look
closely at their flowers and fruits,
you will find they answer generally to the
descriptions you have been reading.</p>

<p>Early in May, when the orchard is still gray and
dreary, suddenly we notice that the upper branches of
the cherry tree look as though a light snow had fallen.
It seems as if the lovely blossoms had burst forth in
an hour. One’s heart gives a joyful jump. Summer
is really coming. The flowers of May promise the fruit
of June.</p>

<p>But when we find the blossoms of the wild cherry, it
is several weeks later. Some of the little wood flowers
have already come and gone. The trees are thick with
leaves before we discover the fragrance of its slender,
drooping clusters; for, though in other ways these
blossoms are almost exactly like those of the cultivated
cherry, they are much smaller, and grow differently on
the branches.</p>

<p>This same difference in size and manner of growing
you will find between the wild and the cultivated fruits.
You country children know well the little chokecherries
(Fig. <a href="#039">29</a>) that are so pretty and so plentiful along the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
lanes. These hang in bunches that remind you somewhat
of the clusters of the currant. They are much
smaller than the market cherry; yet if you cut one
through, you will see that in make-up it is almost exactly
like its big sister.</p>

<p>Those of you who live near the sea find wild beach
plums (Fig. <a href="#040">30</a>) growing thickly along the sand hills.
These are hardly larger
than good-sized grapes;
yet if you cut them
open, you see that they
are really plums.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp35" id="040" style="max-width: 62.5em;">

</figure>

<p>In our woods and
fields we do not find
any wild peaches. The
peach was brought to
us from far-away Persia.
Only in the garden and
orchard do we meet its beautiful pink blossoms. To
see these growing naturally we must go to their Persian
home.</p>

<p>So, while we remember that the cherry, the plum,
and the peach belong to one little group because of
their likeness to one another, let us not forget that
the peach is one of the foreign members of the Rose
family.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="IN_THE_WOODS">IN THE WOODS</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">What</span> do you say this morning to going to the
woods rather than to either garden or orchard?</p>

<p>Not that I am ready to take back anything I said at
the beginning of this book about the delights of the
orchard as a playground. For actual play I know of
no better place. An apple tree is as good a horse as it
is a house, as good a ship as it is a mountain. Other
trees may be taller, finer to look at, more exciting to
climb; but they do not know how to fit themselves to
the need of the moment as does an apple tree.</p>

<p>But for anything besides play, the woods, the real
woods, are even better than the orchard. The truth is,
in the woods you have such a good time just living, that
you hardly need to play; at least you do if you are
made in the right way.</p>

<p>So now we are off for the woods. We have only to
cross a field and climb a fence, and we are in the lane
which leads where we wish to go.</p>

<p>Through the trees comes a golden light. This is
made partly by the sunshine, but mostly by the leaves
turned yellow. These yellow leaves mean that summer
is over. It is in summer, when we are having our
vacation, that the leaves work hardest; for leaves have
work to do, as we shall learn later. But now they are
taking a rest, and wearing their holiday colors.</p>

<p>Twisting in and out over the rails of the fence are
clusters of berries which are very beautiful when you
look at them closely. Each berry is an orange-colored<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
case which opens so as to show a scarlet seedbox within
(Fig. <a href="#042-1">31</a>). A little earlier in the year you could not
see this bright-colored
seedbox. It is only a
short time since the
outer case opened and
displayed its contents.
These are the berries
of the bittersweet. Last June you
would hardly have noticed its little
greenish flowers, and would have
been surprised to learn that they
could change into such gay fruit.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp35" id="042-1" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/042-1.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 31</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Do you see a shrub close by covered with berries?
These berries are dark blue. They grow on bright-red
stalks. If we wait here long
enough, it is likely that we shall
see the birds alight upon some upper
twig and make their dinner on the
dogwood berries; for this is one of the
Dogwood family,—the red-stalked dogwood,
we call it (Fig. <a href="#042-2">32</a>). When its berries
turn a very dark blue, then the birds
know they are ready to be eaten, just as
we know the same thing by the rosy
cheeks of the apple.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp25" id="042-2" style="max-width: 51.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/042-2.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 32</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>You can be pretty sure that any fruit so
gayly colored as to make us look at it
twice, is trying to persuade some one—some boy or
girl, or bird, or perhaps even some bear—to come and
eat it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>

<p>You have not forgotten, I hope, why these fruits are
so anxious to be eaten? You remember that when their
seeds become ripe, and ready to make new plants, then
they put on bright colors that say for them, “Come
and eat us, for our little seeds want to get out of their
prison!”</p>

<p>Once upon a time these seeds did not find their cozy
seed cases a prison. So once upon a time the baby
robins were content to stay safe in their nest. And
once upon a time all the playground you needed was
a little corner behind your mother’s chair. But seeds,
like birds and babies, outgrow their surroundings, and
need more room.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp20" id="043" style="max-width: 28.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/043.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 33</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Here is a tall shrub with bright-colored leaves, and
clusters of dark red fruit that grow high above our
heads (Fig. <a href="#043">33</a>). It looks something like certain materials
used in fancywork. This shrub is called the
sumac; and if you pick and pull apart one of its
fruit clusters, you find that it is made up of a
quantity of seeds that are covered with little
red hairs. There is nothing soft and juicy
about the fruit of the sumac. Whether it is
ever used as food by the birds, I do not
know. I wish some child would make it his
business to find out about this. Some of you
are sure to live near a clump of sumacs. By
watching them closely for a few weeks, you
ought to discover if any birds feed upon their fruit.</p>

<p>If you do make any such discovery, I hope you will
write a letter telling me of it; and then, if another edition
of this book is published, I shall be able to tell other children<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
more about the fruit of the sumac than I can tell
you to-day.</p>

<p>There are many interesting things about plants yet to
be found out; and you children will find it far pleasanter
to make your own discoveries, using your own bright
eyes, than to read about the discoveries of other people.
Every field, each bit of woods, the road we know so
well leading from home to the schoolhouse, and even
the city squares and parks, are full of interesting things
that as yet we have never seen, even though we may
have been over the ground a hundred times before.</p>

<p>Now let us leave the lane, and strike into the woods
in search of new fruits. This morning we will look
especially for those fruits which by
their bright colors and pleasant looks
seem to be calling out to whomsoever
it may concern, “Come and eat us!”</p>

<p>Close at hand is one of our prettiest
plants. Its leaves look as though
they were trying to be in the height
of the fall fashion, and to outdo even
the trees in brightness of
color. These leaves are set
in circles about the slim stem.
From the top of this grow some purple
berries (Fig. <a href="#044">34</a>).</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp35" id="044" style="max-width: 43.25em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 34</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This plant is the Indian cucumber
root. If one of you boys will dig it
up with your knife, you will find that
its root is shaped a little like a cucumber. Though
I have never made the experiment myself, I am told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
that it tastes something like the cucumber. It is possible,
that, as its name suggests, it was used as food by
the Indians. To hunt up the beginnings of plant names
is often amusing. So many of these are Indian, that in
our rambles through the woods we are constantly reminded
of the days when the red man was finding his
chief support in their plants and animals.</p>

<p>In June we find the flower of the Indian cucumber
root. This is a little yellowish blossom, one of the Lily
family. Small though it is, for one who knows something
of botany it is easy to recognize it as a lily.
Indeed, the look of the plant suggests the wood and
meadow lilies. This is partly because of the way in
which the leaves grow about its stem, much as they do
in these other lilies.</p>

<p>Now look at the beautiful carpet which is spread
beneath your feet. Here you will wish to step very
lightly; for otherwise you might crush some of those
bright red berries which are set thickly among the little
white-veined leaves.</p>

<p>These are called “partridge berries,”—a name given
them because they are eaten by partridges. But the
bare winter woods offer few tempting morsels for bird
meals; and it seems likely that the nuthatch and snowbird,
the chickadee and winter wren, hail with delight
these bright berries, and share with the partridges the
welcome feast.</p>

<p>Please look closely at one of the berries in Fig. <a href="#046">35</a>,
and tell me whether you see anything unusual.</p>

<p>“There are two little holes on top.”</p>

<p>Yes, that is just what I hoped you would notice. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
do not know of any other berries in which you could
find these two little holes; and as I do not believe it
would be possible for you to guess what made these
holes, I will tell you about them.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="046" style="max-width: 62.5em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 35</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>The flowers of the partridge vine always grow in
twos. The seedboxes of these two flowers are joined
in one. So when the flowers fade away, only the one
seedbox is left. When this ripens, it becomes the
partridge berry; and the two little holes show where
the two flowers were fastened to the seedbox.</p>

<p>Try not to forget this, and early next July be sure to
go to the woods and look for the little sister flowers.
Perhaps their delicious fragrance will help you in your
hunt for their hiding place. Then see for yourselves
how the two blossoms have but one seedbox between
them (Fig. <a href="#046">35</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p>Now, we must take care not to wet our feet, for the
ground is getting damp. We are coming to that lovely
spot where the brook winds beneath the hemlocks after
making its leap down the rocks. What is that
flaming red spot against the gray rock yonder?</p>

<p>As we draw nearer, we see that a quantity of
scarlet berries are closely packed upon a thick
stalk (Fig. <a href="#047-1">36</a>).</p>

<p>Do you know the name of the plant which
owns this flaming fruit?</p>

<p>If you were in these woods last May, at
every turn you met one of those quaint little
fellows we call “Jack-in-the-pulpit.”</p>

<figure class="figright illowp15" id="047-1" style="max-width: 22em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/047-1.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 36</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Jack himself, you remember, was hidden
almost out of sight by his “pulpit.” This pulpit was
made of a leaf striped green or purple, or both; and
this leaf curled about and above Jack (Fig. <a href="#047-2">37</a>).</p>

<p>After a time the pretty leaf pulpit faded away, and
Jack was left standing all alone.</p>

<p>The lower part of Jack is covered with tiny
flowers. After these had been properly dusted
by the little flies (for flies, not bees, visit Jack),
just as the apple blossom began to change into
the apple, so these tiny flowers began to turn
into bright berries.</p>

<p>While this was happening, Jack’s upper part
began to wither away; and at last all of it that
was left was the queer little tail which you see
at the top of the bunch of berries.</p>

<p>It is said that the Indians boiled these berries, and
then thought them very good to eat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<p>If we were lost in the woods, and obliged to live
upon the plants about us, I dare say we should eat,
and perhaps enjoy eating, many things which now
seem quite impossible;
but until this happens I
advise you not to experiment
with strange
leaves and roots and berries.
Every little while
one reads of the death
of some child as the result
of eating a poisonous
plant.</p>

<p>The next picture (Fig. <a href="#048-1">38</a>) shows you the fruit of
Solomon’s seal. These dark-blue berries hang from
beneath the leafy stem, just as the little flowers hung
their yellow heads last May.</p>

<p>Next come the speckled red berries of the false Solomon’s
seal (Fig. <a href="#048-2">39</a>), a big cousin of the smaller plant.
As you see, this bears its fruit quite differently, all in a
cluster at the upper part of the
stem. These two plants seem to
be great chums, constantly growing
side by side.</p>

<p>We have been so busy and so
happy that the morning has flown,
and now we must be finding our
way home to dinner; for, unlike
the birds, we are not satisfied to dine on berries alone.</p>

<p>At almost every step we long to stop and look at

how to look for them, berries of different sorts
seem thick on every side.</p>

<p>On taller plants grow the odd
white ones, with blackish spots, of
the white baneberry (Fig. <a href="#049-2">41</a>), or
the red ones of the red baneberry.</p>

These look something like little apples.</p>

<p>Here, too, is the black alder, studded with
its red, waxy beads. But we must hurry
on, not stopping by the way. And you
can be sure that those birds we hear chirruping
above us are glad enough to be left to
finish their dinner in peace.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="WHY_SEEDS_TRAVEL">WHY SEEDS TRAVEL</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">At</span> last I think we all understand that by the red of
the apple, the purple of the plum, and the different
colors worn by the berries we find in the woods,
these plants are inviting us, and the birds also, to eat
their fruit, and so release from prison their little seeds.</p>

<p>But what would happen, do you suppose, if no one
should accept this invitation? What would become of
their seeds if these pears and apples and berries were
not eaten by boys and girls and birds?</p>

<p>Most of this question you can answer for yourselves.</p>

<p>If you leave the apple on the tree, after a time it
falls off upon the ground; and unless picked up, there
it lies till it decays. In the orchard every fall you see
apples decaying on the ground. In a little while the
fleshy part disappears, and the little seeds are thus let
out of prison without help.</p>

<p>But many plants are not satisfied to leave their seeds
so near home. Why is this, do you suppose?</p>

<p>Well, this is quite a long story.</p>

<p>All plants of the same kind need just the same sort
of food. If too many apple trees grow together, they
soon use up all the apple-tree food in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>So if a seed is to grow into a strong, hearty, well-fed
plant, it ought to begin life in some place not already
full of plants in search of just the food that it needs for
itself.</p>

<p>If a plant or tree makes its fruit so good to eat that
some boy or girl or bird is likely to pick it, the chances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
are that it will be carried at least a short distance before
its seeds are dropped upon the ground.</p>

<p>Once in a while a plant is rewarded for its pains by
having its young carried thousands of miles.</p>

<p>Think how far from its home the peach has traveled.
As I told you before, it comes to us from Persia.</p>

<p>Now, if the Persian peach tree had not made its fruit
very juicy and delicious, it is not likely that any one
would have taken the trouble to bring its seeds way over
here to us.</p>

<p>But this peach being what it is, one of the most delicious
of fruits, the tree was rewarded for its pains by
having its children taken where they were petted, and
made much of, and had things all their own way; for
no other peach trees were on hand to do their best to
crowd them out.</p>

<p>Then think of the little partridge berry. The fleshy
part of this the birds eat and digest. But the little
seeds pass unharmed from the bird’s stomach to the
earth, sometimes many miles from the woods where
they were born.</p>

<p>What is true of the peach and of the partridge berry
is true of many other fruits.</p>

<p>Without the help of man or bird or beast, these little
seeds could at last get out of their seed cases; but
without such help, often they could not get the start in
life they need.</p>

<p>So it would seem as if a fruit’s bright color and delicious
flavor were saying to us not only, “Come and eat
us and set our seeds free,” but also, “and carry us far
away, so that we may have a fair chance in the world.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">When</span> I came home from that walk in the woods
the other day, it took me some time to rid my
clothes of many odd-looking little things, such as you
see in the picture above (Fig. <a href="#052-1">43</a>).</p>

<p>This round burr (Fig. <a href="#052-2">44</a>) was one of the worst of my
hangers-on. You know it quite well. It is the fruit of
the burdock. Can some child tell me why I
call this prickly burr a fruit?</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp20" id="052-2" style="max-width: 20.6875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/052-2.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 44</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Now let us look carefully at this seed case or
fruit of the burdock.</p>

<p>Instead of being smooth to the touch, like
some other fruits we know, such as the apple and the
pear, it is covered with stiff hooks. By these hooks it
fastened itself so firmly to my clothes, that it was difficult
to pull it off without making a tear.</p>

<p>Why does the burdock put its seeds into such a
prickly case?</p>

<p>Please stop reading for a moment and try to answer
this question.</p>

<p>Cudgel well your brains for the use of such a prickly
seed case as that of the burdock plant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span></p>

<p>Now I am hoping that one of you children will be
able to think out some such answer as this:—</p>

<p>“Of course, the burdock plant doesn’t want its seeds
to fall on the piece of ground that has been used up
already by other burdocks, any more than the partridge
vine wishes to drop its seeds in the same little hollow
where other partridge vines have eaten all the good
food. As this burdock plant cannot make its seed
case so bright and pretty, and good to eat, that the
birds will carry it off, it must manage in some other
way to send its seeds on their travels. And this is
what it does: it covers the seed case with little hooks.
When the seeds inside are quite ripe, this case breaks
off very easily. So when the children come hunting
berries, it hooks itself to their clothes, or else it catches
in the hair of their dogs, or takes hold of the wool of
grazing sheep, and gets carried quite a way before it
is picked or rubbed off. When that happens, it is far
enough from its old home to set up for itself.”</p>

<p>I should indeed be pleased if one of you children
could give me some such answer as that.</p>

<p>So you see this prickly seed case does just as much
for its little charges as the juicy apple and velvety
peach do for theirs.</p>

<p>And the same thing is true of all those other hooked,
or barbed, or prickly little objects that I picked off my
clothes the other day, and that cling to you when you
take a walk in the fall woods.</p>

<p>They are all fruits. They are the ripe seed cases of
the different plants.</p>

<p>But they are dull-looking, and often quite vexing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
instead of being pleasant to the sight and taste and
touch.</p>

<p>This makes no difference, however, in their having
things pretty much their own way. We do not in the
least want to carry abroad these little torments, scattering
far and wide their seeds, so that another year there
will be more burrs and barbs and bristles than ever, to
tear our clothes and worry our dogs; but they force us
to do them this service, whether we will or no, and
never stop to say “By your leave.”</p>

<p>At every turn they are waiting for us. Where we
climb the fence, and cross the fields, and break through
the woods, we can almost fancy that we hear them
whispering together, “Here they come! Now is our
chance!”</p>

<p>They remind us of those lazy tramps that lie along
the railway, getting on the trucks of passing trains, and
stealing rides across the country.</p>

<p>These ugly hooked fruits have one great advantage
over the pretty ones that are good to eat. They do not
have to wait our pleasure. But when we are most
busy and hurried, without a moment to loiter in the
apple orchard or among the berry bushes, then, quite
as well as, if not better than, during our leisure
moments, they lay hold upon us with their tiny claws,
and cling closely till we set to work to get rid of them.
When we pick them off and fling them to the ground,
we are doing just what they most wish.</p>

<p>In this picture (Fig. <a href="#054">45</a>) you see the seed case of
the tick trefoil. This plant belongs to the Pea family;
and its fruit is really a pod, something like that of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
garden pea. But when this pod of the tick trefoil is
ripe, it splits into five little pieces. Each piece is a
separate seed case. This is covered with hooked
hairs, by means of which it fastens itself to our
clothing and to the hair of animals, just as the
burr of the burdock did. These little seed cases
go by the name of “ticks.”</p>

<p>Here is the fruit of the stick-tight (Fig. <a href="#055-1">46</a>).
You see its two teeth that are so well fitted to weave
themselves into either cloth or hair.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#055-2">47</a> shows you a strange and terrible fruit of this
same class. It grows on an
African plant, and may fasten
itself so firmly into the hair
of animals, that the attempt
to get it out is almost hopeless.
Sometimes an unfortunate
lion will kill himself in
his efforts to wrench this
tormenting seed case from
his skin. In his struggles he gets it into his mouth,
and so dies.</p>

<p>I am glad to say we have nothing so terrifying as
this among our hooked fruits.</p>

<p>Even if at times you are tempted to lose your patience
with such impertinent little tramps as they are, I think
you can hardly help admiring the clever way in which
they manage to get a free ride.</p>

</figure>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">On</span> your way to school these fall days, often
you notice certain white, silky things
floating lazily through the air. Sometimes you
catch one of these little objects, and blow it
away again with a message to a friend. Or perhaps
you wish upon it. At least, this is what I
did as a child. Life in those days was full of
these mysterious “wishes.” A white horse, a
hay cart, the first star, a wandering thistle
down,—each promised the possible granting
of one’s most secret wish.</p>

<p>That the thistle down comes from the thistle
plant, you know. But not all the silky things
that look like fairy sailboats are thistle down,
for many plants beside the thistle let loose these
tiny air ships.</p>

<p>Have you ever wondered where they come from,
what they are doing? Or do they seem to you so lazy,
so drifting, so aimless, that you doubt if they are going
anywhere in particular, or have really anything to do?</p>

<p>But by this time you have learned that plants have
better reasons for their actions than you had dreamed
before you began to pay them some attention. You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
have discovered that they dress their
flowers in gay colors so that the bees
may be tempted to visit them and powder
them with golden dust. You have
learned that they make their fruits juicy
and delicious so that boys and girls and
birds may be persuaded to carry off their seeds; and
the better you know them, the more certain you feel
that they manage their affairs with much common sense,
that they are not likely to take time and trouble for
nothing.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp20" id="057-1" style="max-width: 36.6875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/057-1.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 48</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>So let us look closely at some of these air ships, and
try to guess their errand.</p>

<p>I hope that some time ago you were told to get together
as many different kinds as you
could find, and to bring them
here this morning.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp25" id="057-2" style="max-width: 42.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/057-2.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 49</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In this picture you see some of
the air ships of the milkweed
(Fig. <a href="#057-2">49</a>).</p>

<p>The lower part of Fig. <a href="#057-1">48</a> is a seedbox
of the milkweed. To this are
fastened the silky threads which make
the sail that carries the seed through
the air with the least wind, just as the
canvas sail carries the boat across the water.</p>

<p>Can you think of some other plants that
send abroad seed sailboats?</p>

<p>Perhaps some of you remember the beautiful
pink or purple flowers which grew last
summer in tall spikes along the road and up the mountain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
side. These were borne upon a plant called sometimes
fireweed and again willow herb (Fig. <a href="#058-1">50</a>). The
first name was given to it because it grows freely
in places that have been laid waste by
fire. The latter one it owes to its
leaves, which look somewhat like
those of the willow.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp25" id="058-1" style="max-width: 36.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/058-1.jpg" alt="">

</figure>

<p>By the end of August most
of these beautiful blossoms had
disappeared, leaving in their
place the fruit. This fruit of
the fireweed or willow herb is
a long pod such as you see in
the picture (Fig. <a href="#058-2">51</a>). This pod
is packed full of seeds, to each one of
which is fastened a silky sail. Finally all
these pods split open, letting out their little
air ships (Fig. <a href="#058-3">52</a>), and giving a beautiful,
feathery look
to the great
patches in
which they are found.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp20" id="058-3" style="max-width: 41.75em;">

<p>Another plant which
launches
air ships is
the clematis.
In August
its
pretty white
blossoms
clamber over the stone wall, and twist about the bushes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
and trees, making the lanes very lovely. In the fall
this climber is almost as pretty as in summer, for its
fruit clusters (Fig. <a href="#058-4">53</a>) are
made of such long-tailed
seeds as you see in Fig.
<a href="#058-5">54</a>. When these open, and
float away with the first
light wind, you can see
how well their little sails
are fitted to catch the
breeze.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp25" id="059-1" style="max-width: 56.3125em;">

<p>In October and November
nearly every roadside
is lined with clusters such
as you see in the next picture,
except that the picture
cannot give their soft,
velvety look. These are the fruit
clusters of the golden-rod (Fig.
<a href="#059-1">55</a>), made up of quantities of
silky-tailed seeds such as you see
above (Fig. <a href="#059-2">56</a>).</p>

<p>And this is the fruit cluster of
the aster (Fig. <a href="#059-3">57</a>). Each little
puffball is composed of many
aster seeds (Fig. <a href="#059-4">58</a>).</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp25" id="059-3" style="max-width: 46.625em;">

<p>The pasture thistle is almost
as beautiful in fruit as in flower.
It swells up into a great silvery
cushion, which finally vanishes in a cloud of floating
thistle down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<p>And here is the fruit cluster of the dandelion (Fig.
<a href="#060-1">59</a>), and also a single seed sailboat (Fig. <a href="#060-2">60</a>).</p>

<p>Hundreds of other plants attach these
little sails to their seeds. You can hardly
walk a step in the fall along the country
roads without meeting these masses of
feathery fruit made up of just such seeds.
So now we come back to our
questions, “Where are they
going? What are they doing?”</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp25" id="060-1" style="max-width: 51.4375em;">

<p>And as you have learned why the apple
tree and the partridge vine pack their
seeds in pretty cases, and why the burdock
and the stick-tight cover theirs with
hooks and bristles, you ought to answer
these questions very easily. You found that those plants
wished to send their little seeds abroad, so that they
might get a better foothold in some piece of earth that
was not used already by plants hungry for the very
food that they most needed.</p>

<p>This is just what the thistle and milkweed and dandelion
and aster want for their seeds; and this is why
they fasten them to little sails, and send them far away
on a voyage of discovery.</p>

<p>Nearly all of these seeds
you can find for yourselves
when you wander about the
country. Indeed, if you have
eyes that are good for anything,
many of them you cannot
help seeing. It is all
very well to read about these
plants and trees, and to look<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
at pictures of their flowers and fruits, and to have
your teacher bring into the schoolroom specimens for
examination. If this is all the city children can do
(although even in the city one can do more than this),
why, surely it is far better than nothing.</p>

<p>But best of all is it to go right into the woods and
fields where these strange, interesting creatures are
living, and to see for yourselves their manners and
customs.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Down</span> by the brook and along the
sides of the mountain grows a
tall shrub which is called the
witch-hazel. I hope some of you
know it by sight. I am sure that
many of you know its name on account of the extract
which is applied so often to bruises and burns.</p>

<p>This picture (Fig. <a href="#063-2">71</a>) shows you a witch-hazel branch
bearing both flowers and fruit; for, unlike any other
plant I know, the flower of the witch-hazel appears late
in the fall, when its little nuts are almost ripe. These
nuts come from the flowers of the previous year.</p>

<p>It is always to me a fresh surprise and delight to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
come upon these golden blossoms when wandering
through the fall woods.</p>

<p>Often the shrub has lost all its leaves before these
appear. You almost feel as if the yellow flowers had
made a mistake, and had come out six months ahead
of time, fancying it to be April instead of October.
In each little cluster grow several blossoms, with flower
leaves so long and narrow that they look like waving
yellow ribbons.</p>

<p>But to-day we wish chiefly to notice the fruit or nut
of the witch-hazel.</p>

<p>Now, the question is, how does the witch-hazel manage
to send the seeds which lie inside this nut out into
the world? I think you will be surprised to learn just
how it does this.</p>

<p>If you have a nut before you, you see for yourselves
that this fruit is not bright-colored and juicy-looking,
or apparently good to eat, and thus likely to
tempt either boy or bird to carry it off; you see that
it is not covered with hooks that can lay hold of your
clothing, and so steal a ride; and you see that it has
no silky sails to float it through the air, nor any wings
to carry it upon the wind.</p>

<p>And so the witch-hazel, knowing that neither boy nor
girl, nor bird nor beast nor wind, will come to the rescue
of its little ones, is obliged to take matters into its own
hands; and this is what it does. It forces open the
ripe nut with such violence, that its little black seeds
are sent rattling off into the air, and do not fall to the
ground till they have traveled some distance from home.
Really they are <em>shot</em> out into the world (Fig. <a href="#065">72</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p>If you wish to make sure that this is actually so,
gather some of these nuts, and take them home with
you. It will not be long before they begin to pop open,
and shoot out their little seeds.</p>

<p>Did you ever hear of Thoreau? He was a man who
left his friends and family to live by himself in the
woods he so dearly loved. Here he grew to know
each bird and beast, each flower and tree, almost as
if they were his brothers and sisters. One day
he took home with him some of these nuts, and
later he wrote about them in his journal,—</p>

<p>“Heard in the night a snapping
sound, and the fall of
some small body on the floor
from time to time. In the morning I found
it was produced by the witch-hazel nuts on
my desk springing open and casting their seeds quite
across my chamber.”</p>

<figure class="figright illowp35" id="065" style="max-width: 61.625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/065.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 72</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Now, I do not want any of you children to go off
by yourselves to live in the woods; but I should like
to think that you could learn to love these woods and
their inmates with something of the love that Thoreau
felt. And if you watch their ways with half the care
that he did, some such love is sure to come.</p>

<p>Although the witch-hazel’s rough way of dealing
with its young is not very common among the plants,
we find much the same thing done by the wild geranium,
or crane’s bill, and by the touch-me-not.</p>

<p>The wild geranium is the pretty purplish, or at times
pink flower which blossoms along the roads and in the
woods in May and early June.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>

<p>Its seedbox has five divisions. In fruit this seedbox
tapers above into a long beak, which gives the plant
its name of “crane’s bill.” When the
fruit is quite ripe, it splits away from the
central part of this beak in five separate
pieces, which spring upward so suddenly
that the seeds are jerked out of the five
cells, and flung upon the earth at a distance
of several feet. The picture (Fig.
<a href="#066-1">73</a>) shows you how this is done. But a
little search through the summer woods
will bring you to the plant itself; and if
you are patient, perhaps you will see
how the wild geranium gets rid of its
children. But though this habit may at
first seem to you somewhat unmotherly, if you stop to
think about it you will see that really the parent plant
is doing its best for its little ones. If they should fall
directly upon the ground beneath, their chances in life
would be few. About plants, as about people, you must
not make up your minds too quickly.</p>

<p>Another plant that all of you country children ought
to know, is the touch-me-not, or jewelweed. Sometimes
this is called “lady’s eardrop,” because its pretty, red-gold,
jewel-like flowers remind us of the
drops that once upon a time ladies wore
in their ears. These flowers we find in
summer in wet, woody places. In the
fall the fruit appears. This fruit is a
little pod (Fig. <a href="#066-2">74</a>) which holds several seeds. When
this pod is ripe, it bursts open and coils up with an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
elastic spring which sends these seeds also far from
home (Fig. <a href="#067-1">75</a>).</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 75</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This performance of the touch-me-not you
can easily see; for its name “touch-me-not”
comes from the fact that if you touch too roughly
one of its well-grown pods, this will spring open
and jerk out its seeds in the way I have just
described.</p>

<p>In Europe grows a curious plant called the
“squirting cucumber” (Fig. <a href="#067-2">76</a>). Its fruit is a small
cucumber, which becomes much inflated with
water. When this is detached from its stalk, its
contents are “squirted” out as if from a fountain,
and the seeds are thus thrown to a distance
of many feet.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">At</span> the head of this chapter you
see the fruit of the chestnut
tree (Fig. <a href="#067-3_2">77</a>).</p>

<p>What fine October days this picture
brings to mind,—clear, cold
mornings when we arm ourselves
with baskets and a club, and go
chestnuting.</p>

<p>Usually the boys climb the
tree, and shake the
branches till the open burrs rattle out their
contents. But sometimes a teasing cluster refuses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
to set loose its treasure. Then the club comes into
play. If it strikes the great burrs, and raps out their
fat chestnuts, a shout of joy follows.</p>

<p>What a delight it is to hunt in the long grass for the
glossy brown beauties just after a sudden shower from
above! No one speaks. All are bent low in breathless
search.</p>

<p>I know of nothing much more perfect in its way
than an open chestnut burr, still holding its two or
three fine nuts. Its green, prickly outer covering makes
a fine contrast to the velvety brown lining; and within
this beautiful case the plump, shining nuts are laid with
the daintiest care.</p>

<p>Perhaps the chestnut burr is even safer as a seed
case than the apple. While its seeds (the chestnuts)
are young and unripe, it does not stop to plead, “Pray;
don’t destroy my baby nuts!” but it seems to call out
sternly, “Hands off!” and promptly punishes the boy
or girl who disobeys this rough command.</p>

<p>But when the chestnut seeds are quite ripe, then it
opens as wide as it knows how; and very tempting it
looks as it unfolds its contents. A chestnut tree in
October looks like one great invitation.</p>

<p>The acorn (Fig. <a href="#068">78</a>), the seed of the oak tree, is
pretty enough as a plaything, but less pleasing than
the chestnut. Only the squirrel seems to find it
fair eating.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp15" id="068" style="max-width: 15.4375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/068.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 78</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The trees which hide their seeds in nutshells contrive
in different ways to send them abroad.</p>

<p>Many of these nuts are hoarded as winter food by
the squirrels. Often in a moment of fright these little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
creatures drop them by the way. Again, they forget
just where they deposited their hoard, or for some other
reason they leave it untouched. Thus many nuts are
scattered, and live to change into trees.</p>

<p>Others may fall into the water, and float to distant
shores. The cocoanut, for example, has been carried
in this way for hundreds of miles. Its outer covering
protects the seed from being soaked or hurt by water;
and when at last it is washed upon some distant shore,
it sends up a tall cocoanut tree.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">When</span> I began to tell you children about the different
ways in which plants send their young
out into the world, I had no idea that I should take so
much time, and cover so many pages with the subject.
And now I realize that I have not told you one half,
or one quarter, of all there is to tell.</p>

<p>You have learned that seeds are scattered abroad by
animals that eat the bright cases in which they are
packed, and by animals into whose hair or clothing
they manage to fasten themselves.</p>

<p>You know that sometimes seeds are blown through
the air by means of silky sails to which they are fastened,
or else by their little wings.</p>

<p>You discovered that certain plants actually pushed
their young from their cozy homes in no gentle fashion,
much as a mother bird shoves her timid little ones from
the edge of the nest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span></p>

<p>And in the last chapter you read that occasionally
seeds were floated by water to distant shores.</p>

<p>Now, these are the chief ways in which plants contrive
to dispose of their seeds; but they are not the
only ways. Before leaving the subject altogether, I
will mention a few plants which use other contrivances.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp15" id="070-1" style="max-width: 19.6875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/070-1.jpg" alt="">

</figure>

<p>This picture (Fig. <a href="#070-1">79</a>) shows you the fruit of the
poppy. Many of you know it well. In the fall
you find in the garden these pretty seedboxes.
They answer famously as pepper pots, if one
chances to be playing house in the orchard.</p>

<p>Just below the top of the poppy seedbox the
picture shows you a circle of little openings; and
inside the seedbox are many poppy seeds (Fig. <a href="#070-2">80</a>).</p>

<p>But how can seeds get out of these openings,
do you suppose?</p>

<p>If they were lower down, it would be an easy matter
for the seeds to drop out, right on the ground. But
perhaps it is well that this cannot happen. Did such
a quantity of seeds fall upon one small bit of
earth, they would have a poor chance for life.</p>

<p>Well, then, you ask, must they wait patiently in
the seedbox till some child comes along and pulls
it off for a pepper pot?</p>

<figure class="figright illowp15" id="070-2" style="max-width: 16.875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/070-2.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 80</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>No, they are not obliged to wait always for
you children. This is fortunate for the poppy
plants that are so unlucky as to live in lonely gardens
where no children ever play.</p>

<p>Then what <em>does</em> happen?</p>

<p>If you will go out into the garden the next windy
fall day, you will see for yourselves. You will see the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
tall poppy plants swaying to and fro with every gust
of wind; and you will see how the seedboxes are
tossed from side to side, and that every now and then
a very violent toss sends the little seeds tumbling head
over heels out of the little openings just as effectively
as if the wind too were playing house and using them
as pepper pots.</p>

<p>When the seeds are let loose in this way, the tall
poppy plants are swayed so far to one side, and the
wind is blowing so hard, that they land upon the
ground much farther from home than would have been
the case had they fallen through openings cut in the
lower part of the seedbox.</p>

<p>In the East grows a strange plant called the “rose
of Jericho.” Its fruit is a pod. When this plant is
nearly ready to get rid of its seeds, what do you think
it does? It lets go its hold upon the earth, curls itself
up into a little ball, and is driven here and there by
the wind. When it finds a nice damp place, it stops
and uncurls itself; and the little pods
split open, and drop their seeds on
the earth.</p>

<p>Some plants bear fruit that look
very much like insects. It is believed
that sometimes these are taken for
such, and snapped up by birds, and
thus succeed in getting away from
home.</p>

<p>This picture (Fig. <a href="#071">81</a>) shows you
a pod which, as it lies upon the ground, looks like a
centiped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span></p>

<p>Here you have a seed which is shaped and
marked like a beetle (Fig. <a href="#072-1">82</a>).</p>

<p>The next picture (Fig. <a href="#072-2">83</a>) shows you a seed
from the castor-oil plant. You can see that it
might easily be mistaken for some insect.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp10" id="072-1" style="max-width: 12.0625em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 82</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Think how disappointed the bird must be,
after having greedily snapped up and carried off one
of these little objects, to discover that for all his pains
he has secured nothing but a dry, tough pod or seed.</p>

<p>But if the mother plant really does any thinking at
all, cannot you fancy how she chuckles with delight
over the trick she has played, and the clever way in
which she has started her young on its travels?</p>

<p>There is still another way in which birds help to
scatter seeds. They alight in wet places, covering
their little feet with mud. Now, a clot of mud may
contain many different seeds; and for days this clot
may stick to the bird’s foot, and thus cause the seeds
it holds to be carried for hundreds of miles.</p>

<p>Have you ever heard of Darwin? He was a great
man who spent most of his life in studying plants and
animals.</p>

<p>How many years do you suppose he was interested
in the study of those long, brown worms which you
find in quantities in the lawn and after heavy rains
along the sidewalk? At intervals for forty-four years
he studied these little creatures which you girls think
ugly and uninteresting enough, although the boys know
they make fine fish bait.</p>

<p>Well, Darwin once raised eighty-two plants from
seeds contained in a clot of earth which was clinging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
to the leg of a partridge. So you can see that when
a bird gets his feet wet, he may really be doing the
world a service. And it is not likely that he takes cold
himself.</p>

<p>Now, I want you children to see how many different
ways you can recall in which plants scatter abroad their
little seeds; and later I want you to go out into the
garden, or into the woods, and see if you cannot discover
many of the seeds about which you have been
reading. But better still it would be if you could find
others of which I have told you nothing.</p>

<p>I should like you to make a list of the different plants
which you find in fruit, putting after each name a slight
description of the way in which it gets rid of its seeds.
This will not be a stupid task at all if you set your
mind to it. It will give your walks a new pleasure,
and it will bring to your school work something of the
freshness and joy which belong to the woods.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">When</span> these little seeds at last find a good resting
place, what do you think happens to them?
They grow into new plants, of course. But how does
this come about? How does a seed turn into a plant?</p>

<p>I could hardly expect you to guess this, any more
than I could have expected you to guess how the apple
flower changes into the apple fruit. I will tell you a
little about it; and then I hope your teacher will show
you real seeds and real plants, and prove to you that
what I have said is really so.</p>

<p>Of course, you believe already that I try to tell you
the exact truth about all these things. But people far
wiser than I have been mistaken in what they
thought was true; and so it will be well for you
to make sure, with your own eyes, that I am right

<p>If you should cut in two the seed of that beautiful
flower the garden peony, and should look at
it very closely through a good magnifying glass, you
would find a tiny object such as you see in the half
seed shown in this picture (Fig. <a href="#075_2">84</a>). Both your eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
and your glass need to be very good to show you that
this little object is <em>a baby peony plant</em>. Fig. <a href="#076">85</a> gives
the little plant as it would look if taken out of the seed.</p>

<p>Every ripe seed holds a baby plant; and to become a
grown-up plant, it needs just what boy and girl babies
need,—food and drink and air.</p>

<p>But shut up so tight in its seed shell, how can it get
these?</p>

<p>Well, in this peony seed its food is close at hand. It
is packed away inside the seed, all about the little plant.
In the picture (Fig. <a href="#075_2">84</a>), everything except the little
white spot, which shows the plant, is baby food,—food
that is all prepared to be eaten by a delicate
little plant, and that is suited to its needs just as
milk is suited to the needs of your little sister or
brother.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 85</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The little leaves of the baby plant take in the
food that is needed to make it grow fat and strong.</p>

<p>Now, how does the baby plant get water to drink?</p>

<p>I have asked your teacher to soak over night some
peas that have been dried for planting, and to bring
to school to-day a handful of these, and also a handful
which have not been soaked. She will pass these
about, and you can see how different the soaked ones
are from the others. Those that have not been in the
water look dried and wrinkled and old, almost dead in
fact; while those which have been soaked are nearly
twice as large. They look fat, and fresh, and full of
life. Now, what has happened to them?</p>

<p>Why, all night long they have been sucking in water
through tiny openings in the seed shell; and this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
water has so refreshed them, and so filled the wrinkled
coats and swelled them out, that they look almost
ready to burst.</p>

<p>So you see, do you not, how the water manages to
get inside the seed so as to give the baby plant a drink?</p>

<p>Usually it is rather late in the year when seeds fall to
the earth. During the winter the baby plant does not
do any drinking; for then the ground is frozen hard,
and the water cannot reach it. But when the warm
spring days come, the ice melts, and the ground is full
of moisture. Then the seed swells with all the water
it sucks in, and the baby plant drinks, drinks,
drinks, all day long.</p>

<p>You scarcely need ask how it keeps warm, this
little plant. It is packed away so snugly in the
seed shell, and the seed shell is so covered by
the earth, and the earth much of the time is so
tucked away beneath a blanket of snow, that usually
there is no trouble at all about keeping warm.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 86</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But how, then, does it get air?</p>

<p>Well, of course, the air it gets would not keep alive
a human baby. But a plant baby needs only a little
air; and usually enough to keep it in good condition
makes its way down through the snow and earth to
the tiny openings in the seed shell. To be sure, if the
earth above is kept light and loose, the plant grows more
quickly, for then the air reaches it with greater ease.</p>

<p>So now you see how the little plant inside the peony
seed gets the food and drink and air it needs for its
growth.</p>

<p>In the picture above (Fig. <a href="#077">86</a>) you get a side view<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
of the baby plant of the morning-glory, its unripe seed
being cut in two. As you look at it here, its queer
shape reminds you of an eel. But if instead of cutting
through the seed, you roll it carefully between your
fingers, and manage to slip off its coat, and if then
you take a pin and carefully pick away the whitish,
jelly-like stuff which has been stored as baby food, you
will find a tiny green object which through a magnifying
glass looks like the next picture (Fig. <a href="#078">87</a>). The
narrow piece pointing downward is the stem
from which grows the root. Above this are
two leaves.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp15" id="078" style="max-width: 22.125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/078.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 87</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This baby plant is a very fascinating thing
to look at. I never seem to tire of picking
apart a young seed for the sake of examining
through a glass these delicate bright-green leaves. It
seems so wonderful that the vine which twines far
above our heads, covered with glorious flowers, should
come from this green speck.</p>

<p>As this morning-glory is a vine which lives at many
of your doorsteps, I hope you will not fail to collect its
seeds, and look at their baby plants. When these are
very young, still surrounded by a quantity of baby food,
you will not be able to make them out unless you carry
them to your teacher and borrow her glass; but when
the seed is ripe, and the little plant has eaten away
most of the surrounding food, it grows so big that you
can see it quite plainly with your own eyes.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="A_SCHOOLROOM_GARDEN">A SCHOOLROOM GARDEN</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">I want</span> you children to do a little gardening in the
schoolroom. You will enjoy this, I am sure.</p>

<p>When I was a child, I took great delight in the experiments
that I am going to suggest to you; and now
that I am grown up, I find they please me even more
than they did years ago.</p>

<p>During the past week I have been doing this sort of
gardening; and I have become so interested in the
plant babies which I have helped into the world, that I
have not been at all ready to stop playing with them,
even for the sake of sitting down to tell you about
them.</p>

<p>To start my garden, I had first to get some seeds.
So I put on my hat and went down to the little shop in
the village, half of which is given up to tailor work,
while the other half is devoted to flower raising. The
gray-bearded florist tailor who runs this queer little
place was greatly interested when he heard that I
wanted the seeds so that I might tell you children
something of their strange ways.</p>

<p>“Seeds air mighty interestin’ things,” he said. “Be
you young or be you old, there’s nothin’ sets you
thinkin’ like a seed.”</p>

<p>Perhaps the florist tailor had been fortunate in his
friends; for I have known both grown-up people and
children who year after year could see the wonder of
seed and baby plant, of flower and fruit, without once
stopping to say, “What brings about these changes?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span></p>

<p>To “set thinking” some people would take an earthquake
or an avalanche; but when this sort of thing is
needed to start their brains working, the “thinking” is
not likely to be good for much.</p>

<p>But I hope that some of you will find plenty to think
about in the seeds which your teacher is going to show
you; and I hope that these thoughts may be the beginning
of an interest and curiosity that will last as long as
you live.</p>

<p>The seeds which I got that morning were those of
the bean, squash, pea, and corn; and your teacher has
been good enough to get for you these same seeds, and
she will show you how to do with them just what I have
been doing this past week.</p>

<p>First, I filled a pot with finely sifted earth, and
planted the different seeds; then I filled a glass with
water, floated some cotton wool upon its surface, and
in this wool laid some beans; and then my garden
planting was done.</p>

<p>During the following days I kept the earth in the pot
slightly moist. The cotton wool in the glass of water
did this for itself.</p>

<p>And how carefully I watched my two little gardens!</p>

<p>For three days the pot of earth kept its secret.
Nothing happened there, so far as I could see. But
the beans that were laid upon the cotton wool grew
fat and big by the second day, just like those that your
teacher soaked over night; and by the third day their
seed coats had ripped open a little way, just as your
coat would rip open if it were tightly buttoned up and
suddenly you grew very fat; and out of the rip in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
seed coat peeped a tiny white thing, looking like the
bill of a chick that is pecking its way out of the eggshell
which has become too small to hold it.</p>

<p>Very quickly this little white tip grew longer. It
curved over and bent downward, piercing its
way through the cotton wool into the water.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp20" id="081-1" style="max-width: 28.0625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/081-1.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 88</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>About this time the pot garden began to
show signs of a disturbance. Here and there
I saw what looked like the top of a thick green hoop
(Fig. <a href="#081-1">88</a>).</p>

<p>What had happened, do you think?</p>

<p>Why, first this bean had sucked in from the damp
earth so much water that it had grown too fat and
big for the seed coat; and it had torn this open, just
like the other bean, pushing out its little white tip; and
this tip had bent down into the earth and taken a good
hold there, lengthening into a real root, and sending
out little root hairs that fastened it down still more
firmly.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp10" id="081-2" style="max-width: 11.0625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/081-2.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 89</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But it was not satisfied to do all its growing below.
Its upper part now straightened itself out, and started
right up into the air. From a hoop it turned into a
stem which lifted the bean clear above the earth
(Fig. <a href="#081-2">89</a>).</p>

<p>This bean was no longer the round object we usually
call by that name; for its two halves had opened and
spread outward, and from between these two halves
grew a pair of young leaves.</p>

<p>As these leaves grew larger, the two half-beans
began to shrink, growing smaller and more withered
all the time (Fig. <a href="#082">90</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>Why was this, do you suppose?</p>

<p>To make clear the reason of this, to show just why
the two halves of the bean grew smaller as the rest of
the young bean plant grew larger, I must go back a
way.</p>

<p>Turn to the picture of the peony seed (Fig. <a href="#075_2">84</a>).
There you can see how the baby plant is
packed away in the midst of a quantity of
baby food. And in the picture of the morning-glory
seed (Fig. <a href="#077">86</a>) you see the same
thing.</p>

<p>You remember that day by day the baby
plant ate more and more of this food, and
kept growing stronger and bigger, and that
all this time the store of food kept growing
smaller and smaller.</p>

<p>Now, if you cut open the bean, you do not
see a tiny plant set in the midst of a store of
food.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp20" id="082" style="max-width: 26.9375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/082.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 90</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Why is this? This is because the baby
bean plant keeps its food in its own leaves.</p>

<p>The seed coat of the bean is filled by these leaves,
for each half of the bean is really a seed leaf. In these
two thick leaves is stored all the food that is necessary
to the life of the baby plant; and because of all this
food which they hold, the bean plant is able to get a
better start in life than many other young plants.</p>

<p>If you soak and strip off its seed coat, and pull apart
the two thick leaves, you will find a tiny pair of new
leaves already started (Fig. <a href="#083">91</a>); but you will see nothing
of the sort in the seed of the morning-glory, for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
reason that this is not so well stored with baby food as
to be able to do more than get its seed leaves well
under way.</p>

<p>The pea, like the bean, is so full of food, that it also
is able to take care of a second pair of leaves.</p>

<p>But now to go back to the young bean plant
in the schoolroom garden. We were wondering
why the two halves of the bean, which are
really the first pair of leaves, kept growing
thinner and smaller as the second pair grew
larger.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp20" id="083" style="max-width: 27.875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/083.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 91</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Perhaps you guess now the reason for this.
These first leaves, called the seed leaves, feed all the
rest of the young bean plant.</p>

<p>Of course, as they keep on doing this, they must
themselves shrink away; but they do not cease with
their work till the plant is able to take care of itself.</p>

<p>By this time, however, the seed leaves have nothing
left to live upon. They die of starvation, and soon
fade and disappear.</p>

<p>So now you understand just what has happened to
the leaves that once were so fat and large.</p>

<p>And I hope you will remember the difference between
the seed of the morning-glory and that of the bean,—how
the morning-glory packs the baby food inside
the seed, of course, but <em>outside</em> the baby plant; while
the bean packs it inside the two seed leaves, which are
so thick that there is no room for anything else within
the seed coat.</p>

<p>But really, to understand all that I have been telling
you, you must see it for yourselves; you must hold in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
your hands the dried bean; you must examine it, and
make sure that its seed shell is filled entirely by the
baby plant; you must see it grow plump and big from
the water which it has been drinking; you must watch
with sharp eyes for that first little rip in the seed coat,
and for the putting-out of the tiny tip, which grows
later into stem and root; you must notice how the bent
stem straightens out, and lifts the thick seed leaves up
into the air; and you must observe how that other pair
of leaves, which grows from between the seed leaves,
becomes larger and larger as the seed leaves grow
smaller and thinner, and how, when the little plant is
able to hold its own in the world, the seed leaves die
away.</p>

<p>And if day by day you follow this young life, with
the real wish to discover its secret, you will begin to
understand what the wise old florist tailor meant when
he said,—</p>

<p>“Be you young or be you old, there’s nothin’ sets
you thinkin’ like a seed.”</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> picture at the top of this page (Fig. <a href="#085">92</a>) shows
you how the young squash plant comes into the
world; for you remember that in my pot garden I
planted some squash seeds. And I hope that in your
schoolroom garden you will watch this plant as it makes
its first appearance.</p>

<p>The baby food of the squash vine, like that of the
bean, is stored away inside the seed leaves, which on
this account are so large that they quite fill the seed
shell. They are not so thick as those of the bean, but
thick enough to hold all the nourishment that is needed
to keep the young plant alive and hearty until it is big
enough to shift for itself.</p>

<p>Very soon after this seed is laid in warm, moist earth,
its little plant begins to grow too large for the seed
shell, and the white stem is pushed out through the
hole you notice at one end of the seed. This stem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
forces its way into the earth below, and puts out a root,
and root fingers. And now its upper part begins to
lengthen out and to straighten itself. In doing this,
it pulls the two seed
leaves right out of the
seed coat. If it fails
at once to get rid of
the seed coat, it lifts
this up into the air, on
top of its leaves.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 93</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Often the young
maple tree comes into the world in this way, carrying
its seed coat on top of its seed leaves. The maple
is another plant that packs its baby food
within the seed leaves instead of round
about them. Perhaps your teacher has
saved for you some maple keys (Fig. <a href="#086-1">93</a>),
as the fruit of the maple tree is called. If
you split open a maple key, you will find
hidden within one of its halves (Fig. <a href="#086-2">94</a>) the
beautiful baby tree. This is folded away so
neatly that one is tempted to split open one key after
another, for the pleasure of unpacking other delicate
baby maples (Fig. <a href="#086-3">95</a>).</p>

<figure class="figright illowp20" id="086-2" style="max-width: 28.6875em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 94</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But now let us find out what has happened to
the peas which I planted.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp15" id="086-3" style="max-width: 20.1875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/086-3.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 95</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Peas seem to us so much like beans, that perhaps
you think the young pea baby comes into
the world in the same way as the bean plant; but
surely we have nothing here that looks at all like the
bean plant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span></p>

<p>We see some stems having small, thin, green
leaves.</p>

<p>Where are the fat seed leaves, filled with the
baby food that keeps the plant alive? They are
not in sight, certainly, so we must start a hunt
for them.</p>

<p>If you will carefully remove the
earth from about this little pea plant,
you will soon find that the pea seed
from which it is growing lies buried
in the earth (Fig. <a href="#087-1">96</a>). This pea seed,
like that of the bean, is made up chiefly
of what really are two seed leaves,
although in the case of the pea it may seem
only as a matter of politeness that we give
them the name of “leaves;” for in the pea
these seed leaves lie buried in the earth,
and split open just enough to allow the
little pea plant to grow up into the air.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp15" id="087-1" style="max-width: 21.3125em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 96</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But like the seed leaves of the bean, they
are fat and full of food, and care for the
young plant just as devotedly as did those
of the bean. When this young plant needs
them no more, like those of the bean, they
die of starvation.</p>

<p>Within the acorn, the seed leaves of the
great oak tree grow together. These lie
quietly in the acorn shell while sending out
supplies of food to the root and stem and leaves of the
young oak (Fig. <a href="#087-2">97</a>). Walnut and chestnut leaves act
much in the same manner. But these first leaves of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
walnut do not grow together, as you know. Each one
is packed away separately in half of the walnut shell.</p>

<p>The corn has but one seed leaf, which
makes it unlike all the other plants about
which we have been reading; but it resembles
the pea, the acorn, the walnut, and the
chestnut in this,—that the one seed leaf
lies buried in the earth, as do their
two seed leaves.</p>

<p>The baby corn plant is very small. It does not
fill the whole seed shell, but gets its nourishment
from the food by which it is surrounded.</p>

<p>This picture shows you a seed or grain of corn
cut in two (Fig. <a href="#088-1">98</a>). Of course, this is much larger
than life. In the center you see the tiny plant.
All about is the baby food.</p>

<p>The next picture (Fig. <a href="#088-2">99</a>) shows you the young
corn plant.</p>

<p>I want you to remember that this is the only
plant we have seen with but one seed
leaf. This one seed leaf never comes
out of the seed shell. There are
other plants of the same kind. All
the grass plants have but one seed
leaf, and the blue flag that grows in
wet meadows, and all the lilies.</p>

<p>Only a few plants have more than two
of these seed leaves. The pine trees are
among these few. This picture (Fig. <a href="#088-3">100</a>)
shows you a baby pine tree, still cradled
in its seed, surrounded by baby food; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
the next one (Fig. <a href="#088-4">101</a>) shows you the pine just starting
out in the world, with its six seed leaves.</p>

<p>When you study the botany that is written for older
people, you will find that plants are set apart in separate
groups, according to the number of their seed leaves.</p>

<p>Strange though it may seem to you, plants with but
one seed leaf have certain habits that you will not find
in a plant with two seed leaves; and a plant with two
seed leaves, long after these have passed away, will show
by root and stem that it had more than one seed leaf.</p>

<p>In your schoolroom garden I should like you to grow
side by side, first a plant with but one seed leaf, next a
plant with two seed leaves, and lastly a plant with more
than two.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="SEEDS_AS_FOOD">SEEDS AS FOOD</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">I want</span> you to think for yourselves why it is fortunate
for us human beings that many plants store
away in their seeds so much baby food.</p>

<p>“Because without this the little plants would die, and
we should have no new plants to make the world beautiful
to live in,” some child replies.</p>

<p>That answer is a good one; but it is not just the
answer that I wish.</p>

<p>Can you think of any other way in which we all
benefit by the large supply of baby food that is packed
away in certain seeds?</p>

<p>If the right answer to this question does not occur to
you, try to remember which of those seeds we have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
been reading about have been supplied with a specially
large amount of this food.</p>

<p>You remember that the bean holds so much baby
food in its seed leaves, that these are very fat. So do
the pea, the walnut, and the chestnut. The seed of
corn, also, is well filled with baby food, only in the corn
seed it is packed around the outside of the seed leaves,
instead of the inside.</p>

<p>But the squash, although it puts in its seed leaves
enough food to keep its young plant well and hearty,
does not lay by any great quantity of this material.
Neither does the maple tree, which also stores the seed
leaves with food, but does not fill them nearly so full
as do the bean and the pea.</p>

<p>And the morning-glory, which packs its precious
white jelly (this is what the little morning-glory plant
likes to eat) all about its young, lays up only just
enough of this to last until the baby plant breaks out
of its seed shell.</p>

<p>Now, what difference do we find between these seeds?—between
the seeds of squash, morning-glory, and
maple, which have only a small supply of baby food,
and those other ones, such as bean and pea and corn
and walnut and chestnut, which are packed full of
nourishment?</p>

<p>“Why, these last ones are good to eat!” you exclaim.
“They are part of the food we live upon, while the
squash seeds, the morning-glory seeds, and the maple
seeds are not good to eat.”</p>

<p>Yes, that is the answer which I wished. The baby
food in these seeds makes “grown-up” food for us.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
We get strength and nourishment from the same material
which the mother plant has prepared for her young.</p>

<p>Now try to name the different seeds which help to
make up our food. Already we have mentioned several
kinds. Besides these, there is the oat seed (from which
comes oatmeal), the wheat seed (from which comes
flour for our bread), the coffee seed, the buckwheat
seed, the peanut seed, the almond seed, and many
others, some of which will come to your mind from time
to time.</p>

<p>I wish you would make for your teacher a list of all
those that you can recall; or, better still, I should like
you to collect as many as you possibly can, and bring
them to your next class. If you cannot find the seeds
just as they grow upon the plant, you may be able to
get them prepared for use. A pinch of flour, for instance,
would answer for wheat seeds, of oatmeal for
oat seeds.</p>

<p>I have in mind a number of seeds that you can easily
secure, of which I have not spoken; and it will be interesting
at our next meeting to see which child in this
class is able to make the best exhibition of seed food.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Plant</span> babies are not alike as to the time they take
in finding their way out of the ripe seed shell
into the world.</p>

<p>Certain seeds need only two or three days in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
to bring forth their young. Perhaps we ourselves have
seen the white tip of the bean rip open its shell the
second or third day after being laid upon the moist
cotton wool. But if we had not given this bean plant a
good chance to grow, it would have kept alive and
hearty inside its shell for a long time. This is not the
case with all plants. Certain seeds need to be planted
soon after they are ripe. If they are not, their baby
plants die.</p>

<p>But usually seeds take such good care of their young,
that they will live for a long time, even if shut up in a
dark closet or a table drawer, instead of being comfortably
laid away in the warm, moist earth.</p>

<p>Wonderful stories are told of seeds that have sprouted
after having lain buried in some Egyptian tomb for
thousands of years; but the people best fitted to judge
of the truth of such stories do not believe them. There
is no doubt, however, that some seeds keep their baby
plants alive for many years.</p>

<p>Early in the summer the seeds of the red maple fall
to the ground; and soon after this the young plants find
their way up into the world above. Later in the year
the sugar maple sheds its seeds. These lie sleeping in
the earth through the winter. When the warm spring
days come, the baby plants awake, and stretch themselves,
and join the hundreds of other, just-awakened
baby plants that are flocking into the world above. So
you see that seeds of the same family have different
habits in this matter.</p>

<p>There is one curious tree that lives in swamps along
the seashore of hot countries. It is called the mangrove.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
The baby plants of this tree are so anxious to get out
into the world, that they do not wait until the seeds in
which they are hidden are set free from the mangrove
fruit.</p>

<p>It is as if the little plants inside the apple seed could
not wait until the apple flesh should be eaten or
should decay, but insisted on struggling first out of
the seed into the apple, and then through the apple
into the light and air.</p>

</figure>

<p>This picture (Fig. <a href="#093-1">102</a>) shows you the mangrove
fruit. It looks more like a pear than an apple. In
the middle of this lies hidden one seed. As time
goes on, this grows bigger and bigger, trying to make
room for the impatient little plant within; but it does
not grow fast enough
to please this ambitious
young one, which finally
overcomes the difficulty
by piercing the seed shell
with its stem. This stem
bores its way right down through
the mangrove fruit, and breaks into
the outer air. It keeps on growing
in this way for many weeks, till at last it is a
foot long (Fig. <a href="#093-2">103</a>). Try to fancy how odd a
mangrove tree must look at this time, covered
with mangroves, from each one projecting this
long odd-looking beak, which one could hardly
guess to be the stem of the baby plant within the fruit.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp35" id="093-2" style="max-width: 61.6875em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 103</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We read that these long-beaked fruits bob about with
every breath of wind in a fashion that gives the tree a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
still stranger look than on a day when the air is not
stirring. Picture a pear tree from every pear of which
the long stem of a baby pear tree protrudes. Would
you not be eager to find one of these pears and cut it
open, and see what sort of a baby plant it must be that
could send out such a great stem?</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp10" id="094" style="max-width: 10.9375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/094.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 104</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But perhaps the strangest part of the story is yet to
come. At last all of these great beaks fall away from
the fruit; and from the broken top of each grows a
little bud, such as you see in the picture (Fig. <a href="#094">104</a>).
When this heavy beak falls upon the muddy ground
below, its pointed end strikes first, and so bores into the
earth.</p>

<p>Even if it happens to fall into the water, it does this
with so much force that it will pierce its way to the
depth of eighteen or twenty inches, and yet remain
standing erect when it strikes bottom, where it sends
out a root. When it has secured a good hold, the little
bud unfolds into four leaves. Above these grow larger,
shining leaves; and soon the ground beneath an old
mangrove tree is covered with these daring little
adventurers.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Now</span> let us pause for a moment, and try to recall
a little of what we have learned since school
opened.</p>

<p>We learned that the fruit of a plant is the part which
holds its seed, and that there are many different kinds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
of fruits; that the burr of the burdock, the pod of the
milkweed, the puff of the dandelion, are fruits, as well
as the apple and the pear, the acorn and the walnut.</p>

<p>We learned that the chief importance of these fruits
lies in the fact just mentioned, that they hold the seeds
of the plants.</p>

<p>Then we learned something about the many different
kinds of seeds, and of how these seeds managed to become
separated from the parent plant, and to get a start
in life.</p>

<p>Next we read of the baby plant which lies hidden
within every perfect seed. We learned how this is kept
safe and warm, and supplied with food, and how at last
it finds its way out of the seed shell into the world.</p>

<p>If you have been using this book in the right way,
not only have you read about these things, but you have
seen them with your own eyes.</p>

<p>Some of the fruits you have tasted, and others you
have handled.</p>

<p>You have examined the silky sails of the seeds which
float through the air, and the hooks and claws of those
little tramps that manage to steal free rides.</p>

<p>And some seeds you have planted. These you have
watched day by day, and you have seen that the baby
plants burst their seed shells much as a chick bursts its
eggshell.</p>

<p>Now what I want you to do is this: I want you
to study carefully the different parts of these little
creatures that are living out their strange, beautiful lives
under your very eyes. I want you to watch them from
day to day; to learn how they eat and drink and work<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
and grow, until you feel that you know them really
well.</p>

<p>First let us look at this bean plant which is breaking
its way through the earth.</p>

<p>Just what do you see?</p>

<p>You see what looks like a thick, green hoop
(Fig. <a href="#096-1">105</a>), do you not?</p>

<p>What is it, this odd-looking hoop?</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp15" id="096-1" style="max-width: 30.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/096-1.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 105</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Perhaps some of you still think that it is the
root, for I remember that I too once supposed
the root was the part of the plant which first left the bean.</p>

<p>But really this green hoop is
made by the bent stem. We know
that this is the stem because from
its lower end grows the root, while
from its upper part grow the leaves,
flowers, and fruit.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp15" id="096-2" style="max-width: 34.0625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/096-2.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 106</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Certainly it is curious, the way in which this bean
plant comes into the world. Why does it not grow
straight up and down, do you suppose?—up
with its stem and leaves, and
down with its root?</p>

<p>But we must not forget that whenever
some habit on the part of a plant has
filled us with surprise, sooner or later
we have discovered that the plant’s
reason for it was a good one.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp20" id="096-3" style="max-width: 40.8125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/096-3.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 107</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>What reason can the bean plant have for coming into
the world crooked?</p>

<p>Before reading further, try to think this out for yourselves.
Try each one of you to form an idea of what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
the bean plant gains by pushing through the earth with
this hooped stem.</p>

<p>I hope some of you may guess correctly. But even
if you have not been successful in naming the cause of
the bean plant’s humped back, at least you have been
working your brains; and every time you do this, you
help to keep them in good order.</p>

<p>If you let your brain lie idle, and allow your teacher
or your book to do for you not only all the asking of
questions, but also all the thinking-out of answers, it
will get as dull and rusty and good for nothing as a
machine that is laid by for a long time gets dull and
rusty and good for nothing.</p>

<p>I should be sorry to think that any of you children
were carrying about in your heads any such rusty, good-for-nothing
brains. So if you wish to keep them bright
and clean, and in good working order, you must try to
do your own thinking.</p>

<p>And now, hoping you have tried to guess for yourselves
the reason of this crooked back, I will explain it to you.</p>

<p>But first handle carefully the tip of one of the upper
leaves on the larger bean plant. You see how delicate
this is.</p>

<p>Then feel how firm and hard and tough is the green
hoop of the plant which is just breaking through the
earth.</p>

<p>Now suppose the bean plant had grown straight up
into the air, would not its uppermost part have been the
delicate leaf tips?</p>

<p>Can you not see that these would have been too frail
to work their way uninjured through the earth?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span></p>

<p>But by crooking its stout stem the plant opened quite
easily a path for itself and for its leaves, and no harm
was done anywhere (Figs. <a href="#096-2">106</a>, <a href="#096-3">107</a>). Was not this a
clever thought? But really every step in the life of
the plant is full of interest, if we watch it with sharp
eyes and a brain in good order.</p>

<p>This bean root looks not unlike a bunch
of dirty threads, some quite thick, others
very thin. If you look at these thread-like
roots in a good light, perhaps you may be
able to see growing from them a quantity of
tiny hairs.</p>

<p>Now, what is the use of such a root as this?</p>

<p>Surely some of you are able to guess at
the object of this root, and I will help the
others to the answer.</p>

<p>Give a firm though gentle tug to one of
the larger plants,—one of those that are
growing in the pot of earth.</p>

<p>Does it come out easily in your fingers?</p>

<p>Not at all. Unless you have been really rough, and
used quite a good deal of strength, the little plant has
kept its hold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span></p>

<p>What holds it down, do you suppose?</p>

<p>Ah! Now you know what I am trying to get at.
Its root is what holds it in place; and this holding of
the plant in place is one of its uses.</p>

<p>Its thread-like branches are so many fingers that are
laying hold of the earth. Each little thread makes it
just so much the more difficult to uproot the plant.</p>

<p>I think you know already that another use of the
root is to obtain nourishment for the plant.</p>

<p>These thread-like roots, you notice, creep out on
every side in their search for food and drink. The
water they are able to suck in easily by means of tiny
mouths, which we cannot see. But the plant needs
a certain amount of earth food, which in its solid state
could not slip down these root throats any more easily
than a young baby could swallow a lump of sugar.</p>

<p>Now, how is the plant to get this food, which it needs
if it is to grow big and hearty?</p>

<p>Suppose the doctor should tell your mother that a
lump of sugar was necessary to the health of your tiny
baby brother, what would she do about it?</p>

<p>Would she put the great lump into the baby’s mouth?</p>

<p>You laugh at the very idea. Such a performance
might choke the baby to death, you know quite well.</p>

<p>Perhaps you think she would break the lump into
small pieces, and try to make the baby swallow these;
but even these small pieces might prove very dangerous
to the little throat that had never held a solid morsel.</p>

<p>“She would melt the sugar in water, then the baby
could swallow it,” one of you exclaims.</p>

<p>That is exactly what she would do. She would melt,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
or dissolve as we say, this sugar in water. Then there
would be no difficulty in its slipping down the little
throat; for you know when anything is thoroughly
melted or dissolved, it breaks up into such tiny pieces
that the eye cannot see them. When you melt a lump
of sugar in a glass of water, the sugar is all there as
much as it ever was, although its little grains no longer
cling together in one big lump.</p>

<p>And so when the plant needs some food that the little
root hairs are not able to swallow, it does just what the
mother does. It melts or dissolves the solid food so
that this is able to slip quite easily down the root
throats.</p>

<p>But how does it manage this?</p>

<p>No wonder you ask. A root cannot fill a glass with
water, as your mother did. Even if it could, much of
this solid food which is needed by the plant would not
melt in water, or in anything but certain acids; for you
know that not everything will dissolve, like sugar, in
water.</p>

<p>If I place a copper cent in a glass of water, it will
remain a copper cent, will it not? But if I go into a
drug shop and buy a certain acid, and place in this the
copper cent, it will dissolve almost immediately; that
is, it will break up into so many tiny pieces that you
will no longer see anything that looks at all like a cent.</p>

<p>And as much of this earth food, like the copper cent,
can only be dissolved in certain acids, how is the plant
to obtain them? Certainly it is not able to go to the
drug shop for the purpose, any more than it was able
to fill a glass with water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span></p>

<p>Fortunately it does not need to do either of these
things.</p>

<p>If you will look closely at the root of a plant that
has been raised in water, you will see that it is rough
with a quantity of tiny hairs. These little hairs hold
the acid which can dissolve the solid earth food. When
they touch this food, they send out some of the acid,
and in this it is soon dissolved. Then the little mouths
suck it in, and it is carried up through the root into the
rest of the plant.</p>

<p>Would you have guessed that plants were able to
prepare their food in any such wonderful way as this?
It surprised me very much, I remember, to learn that
a root could give out acids, and so dissolve the earth
food it needed.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="ROOTS_AND_UNDERGROUND_STEMS">ROOTS AND UNDERGROUND STEMS</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">In</span> the last chapter you learned that the root of the
bean plant has two uses.</p>

<p>It holds the plant in place, and it provides it with
food and drink. Such a root as this of the bean plant—one
that is made up of what looks like a bunch of
threads—is called a “fibrous” root.</p>

<p>The next picture shows you the root of a beet plant
(Fig. <a href="#103">109</a>).</p>

<p>Such a thick, fat root as this of the beet is called
a “fleshy” root. The carrot, turnip, radish, and sweet
potato, all have fleshy roots.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span></p>

<p>This beet root, like that of the bean, is useful both
in holding the plant in place and in providing it with
food and drink.</p>

<p>But the fleshy root of the beet does something else,—something
that is not attempted by the fibrous root of
the bean.</p>

<p>Here we must stop for a moment
and look into the life of the beet
plant.</p>

<p>During its first year, the beet puts
out leaves; it neither flowers nor
fruits, but it eats and drinks a great
deal. And as it does not use up any
of this food in flowering or fruiting,
it is able to lay by much of it in its
root, which grows large and heavy in
consequence. When the next spring
comes on, the beet plant is not obliged,
like so many of its brothers and sisters,
to set out to earn its living. This
is provided already. And so it bursts
into flower without delay, its food lying
close at hand in its great root.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp20" id="103" style="max-width: 23.8125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/103.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 109</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>So you see that a fleshy root, like
that of the beet, does three things:—</p>

<p>1. It holds the plant in place.</p>

<p>2. It provides it with food and
drink.</p>

<p>3. It acts as a storehouse.</p>

<p>These plants that lay by food for another year are
useful as food for man. Their well-stocked roots are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
taken out of the ground and eaten by us before the
plant has had the chance to use up its food in fulfilling
its object in life, that of fruiting.
Of course, when it is not allowed
to live long enough to flower and
fruit, it brings forth no young
plants. So a habit which at first
was of use to the plant becomes
the cause of its destruction.</p>

<p>Perhaps you think that the
white potato (Fig. <a href="#104-1">110</a>) is a plant
with a fleshy root.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp20" id="104-1" style="max-width: 51.3125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/104-1.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 110</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>If so, you will be surprised to
learn that this potato is not a root at all, but
a stem.</p>

<p>You think it looks quite unlike any other
stem that you have ever seen. Probably you
do not know that many stems grow underneath
the ground, instead of straight up in
the air.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp15" id="104-2" style="max-width: 27.1875em;">

</figure>

<p>If you find something in the earth that you
take to be a root, you can feel pretty
sure that it really is a stem, if it bears
anything like either buds or leaves. A
true root bears only root branches and
root hairs. But in this white potato
we find what we call “eyes.” These eyes
are buds from which new potato plants
will grow. Close to these are little
scales which really are leaves. So we know that the
potato is a stem, not a root. But this you could not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
have found out for yourselves, even with the sharpest
of eyes.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#104-2">111</a> shows you the thick, fat, underground stem
of the cyclamen. From its lower part
grow the true roots.</p>

<p>Next you have that of the crocus (Fig.
<a href="#104-3">112</a>), while here to the right is that of the
wood lily (Fig. <a href="#105-1">113</a>). This is covered
with underground leaves.</p>

<p>All these stems are usually called roots.
In the botanies such an underground stem
as that of the Jack-in-the-pulpit (Fig. <a href="#105-2">114</a>)
is named a “corm,” while one like that of
the crocus is called a “bulb”
(Fig. <a href="#104-3">112</a>). All have a somewhat
rounded shape.</p>

<p>During our walks in the woods
last fall, often we found the Solomon’s
seal, and stopped to admire
its curved stem, hung with blue
berries. I hope one of you boys
whipped out your pocketknife
and dug into the earth till you found its underground
stem (Fig. <a href="#105-3">115</a>). This was laid lengthwise, its
roots growing from its
lower side. From its
upper side, close to
one end, sprang the
growing plant. But
what causes those
round, curious-looking scars?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>

<p>These scars are what give the plant its name of “Solomon’s
seal.” They are supposed to look like the mark
left by a seal upon wax.</p>

<p>They show where the underground stem has budded
in past years, sending up plants which in turn withered
away. Each plant has left a scar which shows one
year in the life of the underground stem.</p>

<p>Next spring when you find in the woods the little
yellow bells of the Solomon’s seal, I think you will have
the curiosity to dig down and find out the age of some
of these plants.</p>

<p>Another plant with an underground stem is the beautiful
bloodroot. As its name tells you, this so-called
root contains a juice that looks something like blood.
Such underground stems as those of the Solomon’s seal
and bloodroot are called “rootstocks.” Rootstocks,
corms, and bulbs are all storehouses of plant food,
and make possible an early flowering the following
spring.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">But</span> before we finished talking about roots we were
led away by underground stems. This does not
matter much, however, for these underground stems are
still called roots by many people.</p>

<p>Just as stems sometimes grow under ground, roots
sometimes grow above ground.</p>

<p>Many of you know the English ivy. This is one of
the few plants which city children know quite as well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
as, if not better than, country children; for in our cities
it nearly covers the walls of the churches. In England
it grows so luxuriantly that some of the
old buildings are hidden beneath masses
of its dark leaves.</p>

<p>This ivy plant springs from a root in
the earth; but as it makes its way upward,
it clings to the stone wall by means
of the many air roots which it puts forth
(Fig. <a href="#107-1">116</a>).</p>

<p>Our own poison ivy is another plant
with air roots used for climbing purposes.
Often these roots make its stem look as
though it were covered with a heavy growth of coarse hair.</p>

<p>There are some plants which take root in the
branches of trees. Many members of the Orchid family
perch themselves aloft in this
fashion. But the roots which
provide these plants with the
greater part of their nourishment
are those which hang
loosely in the air. One of these orchids
you see in the picture (Fig. <a href="#107-2">117</a>). It is
found in warm countries. The orchids
of our part of the world grow in the
ground in everyday fashion, and look
much like other plants.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp20" id="107-2" style="max-width: 46.375em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 117</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>These hanging roots which you see in
the picture are covered with a sponge-like
material, by means of which they suck in from the
air water and gases.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span></p>

<p>In summer, while hunting berries or wild flowers by
the stream that runs through the pasture, you have
noticed that certain plants seemed to be caught in a
tangle of golden threads. If you stopped to look at
this tangle, you found little clusters of white flowers
scattered along the thread-like stems (Fig. <a href="#108">118</a>); then,
to your surprise, you discovered that nowhere was this
odd-looking stem fastened
to the ground.</p>

<p>It began and ended high
above the earth, among the
plants which crowded along
the brook’s edge.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp35" id="108" style="max-width: 56.125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/108.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 118</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Perhaps you broke off
one of these plants about
which the golden threads
were twining. If so, you
found that these threads were fastened firmly to the
plant by means of little roots which grew into its stem,
just as ordinary roots grow into the earth.</p>

<p>This strange plant is called the “dodder.” When it
was still a baby plant, it lay within its seed upon the
ground, just like other baby plants; and when it burst
its seed shell, like other plants it sent its roots down
into the earth.</p>

<p>But unlike any other plant I know of, it did not send
up into the air any seed leaves. The dodder never
bears a leaf.</p>

<p>It sent upward a slender golden stem. Soon the
stem began to sweep slowly through the air in circles,
as if searching for something. Its movements were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
like those of a blind man who is feeling with his hands
for support. And this is just what the plant was doing:
it was feeling for support. And it kept up its slow
motion till it found the plant which was fitted to give
it what it needed.</p>

<p>Having made this discovery, it put out a little root.
This root it sent into the juicy stem of its new-found
support. And thereafter, from its private store, the
unfortunate plant which had been chosen as the dodder’s
victim was obliged to give food and drink to its
greedy visitor.</p>

<p>And now what does this dodder do, do you suppose?
Perhaps you think that at least it has the grace to do
a little something for a living, and that it makes its
earth root supply it with part of its food.</p>

<p>Nothing of the sort. Once it finds itself firmly rooted
in the stem of its victim, it begins to grow vigorously.
With every few inches of its growth it sends new roots
deep into this stem. And when it feels quite at home,
and perfectly sure of its board, it begins to wither away
below, where it is joined to its earth root. Soon it
breaks off entirely from this, and draws every bit of
its nourishment from the plant or plants in which it
is rooted.</p>

<p>Now stop a moment and think of the almost wicked
intelligence this plant has seemed to show,—how it
keeps its hold of the earth till its stem has found the
plant which will be compelled to feed it, and how it
gives up all pretense of self-support, once it has captured
its prey.</p>

<p>You have heard of men and women who do this sort<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
of thing,—who shirk all trouble, and try to live on the
work of others; and I fear you know some boys and
girls who are not altogether unlike the dodder,—boys
and girls who never take any pains if they can possibly
help it, who try to have all of the fun and none of the
work; but did you ever suppose you would come across
a plant that would conduct itself in such a fashion?</p>

<p>Of course, when the dodder
happens to fasten itself upon
some wild plant, little harm is
done. But unfortunately it is
very partial to plants that are
useful to men, and then we
must look upon it as an enemy.</p>

<p>Linen is made from the flax
plant, and this flax plant is one
of the favorite victims of the
dodder. Sometimes it will attack
and starve to death whole
fields of flax.</p>

<p>But do not let us forget that
we happen to be talking about
the dodder because it is one of
the plants which put out roots above ground.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp35" id="110" style="max-width: 42.5em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 119</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>There is one plant which many of you have seen, that
never, at any time of its life, is rooted in the earth, but
which feeds always upon the branches of the trees in
which it lives.</p>

<p>This plant (Fig. <a href="#110">119</a>) is one of which perhaps you
hear and see a good deal at Christmas time. It is an
old English custom, at this season, to hang somewhere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
about the house a mistletoe bough (for the mistletoe is
the plant I mean) with the understanding that one is
free to steal a kiss from any maiden caught beneath it.
And as mistletoe boughs are sold on our street corners
and in our shops at Christmas, there has been no difficulty
in bringing one to school to-day.</p>

<p>The greenish mistletoe berries are eaten by birds.
Often their seeds are dropped by these birds upon the
branches of trees. There they hold fast by means of
the sticky material with which they are covered. Soon
they send out roots which pierce the bark, and, like the
roots of the dodder, suck up the juices of the tree, and
supply the plant with nourishment.</p>

<p>Then there are water roots as well as earth roots.
Some of these water roots are put forth by plants which
are nowhere attached to the earth. These are plants
which you would not be likely to know about. One of
them, the duckweed, is very common in ponds; but it
is so tiny that when you have seen a quantity of these
duckweeds, perhaps you have never supposed them to
be true plants, but rather a green scum floating on the
top of the water.</p>

<p>But the duckweed is truly a plant. It has both
flower and fruit, although without a distinct stem and
leaves; and it sends down into the water its long, hanging
roots, which yet do not reach the ground.</p>

<p>There are other plants which have at the same time
underground roots and water roots.</p>

<p>Rooted in the earth on the borders of a stream sometimes
you see a willow tree which has put out above-ground
roots. These hang over the bank and float in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
the water, apparently with great enjoyment; for roots
not only seem to seek the water, but to like it, and to
flourish in it.</p>

<p>If you break off at the ground one of your bean
plants, and place the slip in a glass of water, you will
see for yourselves how readily it sends out new roots.</p>

<p>I have read of a village tree the roots of which had
made their way into a water pipe. Here they grew
so abundantly that soon the pipe was entirely choked.
This rapid, luxuriant growth was supposed to have been
caused by the water within the pipe.</p>

<p>So you see there are underground roots and above-ground
roots and water roots. Usually, as you know,
the underground roots get their food from the earth;
but sometimes, as with the Indian pipe, they feed on
dead plants, and sometimes, as with the yellow false
foxglove, on other living roots.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="WHAT_FEW_CHILDREN_KNOW">WHAT FEW CHILDREN KNOW</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">To-day</span> we must take another look at the plants
in the schoolroom garden.</p>

<p>By this time some of them have grown quite tall.
Others are just appearing above the earth.</p>

<p>Here is a young morning-glory (Fig. <a href="#113-1">120</a>). We see
that its stem, like that of the bean, was the first thing
to come out of the seed. This stem has turned downward
into the earth. From its lower end grows the
root, which buries itself deeper and deeper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span></p>

<p>An older plant shows us that the upper part of the
stem straightens itself out and grows upward, bearing
with it a pair of leaves (Fig. <a href="#113-2">121</a>).</p>

<figure class="figright illowp15" id="113-1" style="max-width: 15.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/113-1.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 120</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>From between these starts a tiny bud, that soon
unfolds into a fresh leaf, which is carried upward by
a new piece of stem.</p>

<p>On the tip of this new piece of stem grows
another bud, which also enlarges into a leaf, and in
the same way as before is borne upward (Fig. <a href="#113-3">122</a>).</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp15" id="113-2" style="max-width: 24.1875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/113-2.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 121</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In this fashion the plant keeps growing bigger
and bigger. Soon branches start from the
sides of the stem, and later flowers and fruits.</p>

<p>So we see that it is the stem which bears all
the other parts of the plant.</p>

<p>Most people think that the plant springs
from the root; but you children know better.
With your own eyes, here in the schoolroom,
you have seen that instead of the stem growing
from the root, the root grows from the stem.</p>

</figure>

<p>That more people have not found this out,
is because they do not use their eyes rightly.</p>

<p>Every spring hundreds and thousands of
baby plants make their way out of the seed
shell into the world, just as you saw the baby
bean plant do, sending out first its little stem,
which pointed downward into the earth and
started a root. And every spring there are hundreds
of thousands of men and women, and boys and girls,
who go through the woods and fields, and across the
parks and along the streets, as though they were blind,
taking no notice of the wonders all about them.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Already</span> we have learned that
some stems grow under ground,
and that by most people these are
called roots.</p>

<p>And among those which grow
above the ground we see many different
kinds.</p>

<p>The stem of Indian corn grows
straight up in the air, and needs no
help in standing erect.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#115-1">123</a> shows you the morning-glory
plant, the stem of which is
unable to hold itself upright without
assistance. A great many
plants seem to need this same
sort of help; and it is very interesting
to watch their behavior.</p>

<p>The stem of the young morning-glory
sweeps slowly through the air in
circles, in search of some support.</p>

<p>You remember that the curious dodder
acted in this same way, and that its movements
reminded us of the manner in which a blind
man feels about him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span></p>

<p>When the morning-glory finds just the support it
needs, it lays hold of it, and twists about it, and then
climbs upward with great satisfaction.</p>

<p>I want you to watch this curious performance. It
is sure to amuse you. The plant
seems to know so well what it is
about, and it acts so sensibly when
it finds what it wants.</p>

<p>But if it happens to meet a glass
tube, or something too smooth to give
it the help it needs, it slips off it, and
seems almost as discouraged as a boy
would be who fails in his attempt to
climb a slippery tree or telegraph pole.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp35" id="115-1" style="max-width: 44em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/115-1.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 123</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The bean is another plant whose
stem is not strong enough to hold it erect without help.
But, unlike the morning-glory, the stem of
the bean does not twist about the first
stick it finds. Instead it sends out many
shorter stems which do this work of reaching
after and twining about some support.
In this same way the pea is able to hold
up its head in the world.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp25" id="115-2" style="max-width: 36.5625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/115-2.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 124</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Other plants are supported by their leafstalks.
These twist about whatever sticks
or branches they can find, and so prevent
the plant from falling. The picture (Fig.
<a href="#115-2">124</a>) shows you how the garden nightshade climbs by
its leafstalk. The beautiful clematis clambers all over
the roadside thicket in the same way.</p>

<p>The English ivy and the poison ivy, as we have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
learned already, climb by the help of roots which their
stems send out into the trunks of trees and the crevices
of buildings.</p>

<p>The stems of the Virginia creeper and of the Japanese
ivy give birth to smaller stems, such as you see in
the picture below. When the tips of these reach the wall,
or the tree trunk up which the plant is trying to climb,
they broaden out into little flat, round plates, which,
like tiny claws, cling to the surface (Fig. <a href="#116">125</a>).</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp20" id="116" style="max-width: 28.5625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/116.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 125</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I hope your teacher will tell you where you can find
one of these two plants, for in the country
the creeper is plentiful, and the Japanese ivy
is planted freely in our cities; and I hope
you will go and see how firmly these little
flattened stems cling to the wall or to the
tree trunk. Try gently to pull off one of
these determined little stems, and I think
you will admire it for its firm grip.</p>

<p>There are other than climbing plants
whose stems are not strong enough to stand
up straight without help.</p>

<p>Think of the beautiful water lily. If you have ever
spent a morning in a boat (as I hope you have, for it is
a delightful way to spend a morning) hunting water
lilies, you will remember that these flowers float on top
of the water; and when you reach over to pick them,
you find the tall flower stems standing quite erect in
the water.</p>

<p>But what happened when you broke them off, and
held them in your hand?</p>

<p>Why, these long stems proved to have no strength at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
all. They flopped over quite as helplessly as the
morning-glory vine would do if you unwound it from the
wires up which it was climbing; and you saw that they
had only been able to stand up straight because of the
help the water had given them.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="SOME_HABITS_OF_STEMS">SOME HABITS OF STEMS</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Beside</span> the stems which stand erect without help
(like that of the corn), and those which climb by
means of some support (like those of the morning-glory
and bean), and those which are held up by the water
(like that of the water lily), there are stems which slant
upward (like that of the red clover), stems which lie
upon the ground (like that of the snowberry), and stems
which creep (that is, which run along the ground), and
which strike root, and so give rise to new plants (like
those of the white clover and strawberry).</p>

<p>With the new plants you meet, try always to notice to
which of these different classes their stems belong; for
later, when you wish to use the botany and to learn the
names of the plants, this habit of noticing things will
help you greatly.</p>

<p>Then, too, with every new plant, you should find out
whether its stem is round or square, and whether it is
smooth or hairy, or if it is at all thorny.</p>

<p>The thorns and hairs which some plants scatter over
their stems protect them from animals and insects,
which might otherwise do them an injury.</p>

<p>By the thorns little snails are prevented from climbing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
up the stems and eating away the green leaves
above; and the cows and horses are pretty sure to leave
the thorny plants well alone. It is easy to understand
why we find thistle plants growing thickly in the pasture,
which is nearly bare of everything else. Long ago
these thistles clothed themselves in an armor of prickles,
and ever since they have been successful in waging war
against the cattle.</p>

<p>Sometimes a tree will cover its lower part only with
thorns. Why is this, do you suppose?</p>

<p>This is because only the lower branches are within
reach of the cattle. Only these have any need of a suit
of thorns. The wild pear, which grows in Europe, is
such a tree as this.</p>

<p>A stem that is covered with hairs, and also one that
is sticky in spots, serves to protect its flowers from an
attack by ants, or by other insects that might do them
harm; for these flowers, you remember, hold the golden
dust which works such wonders when carried to another
flower. And you recall, that, when bees go to plants for
the sweet stuff from which honey is made, they carry
this flower dust from blossom to blossom. But if the
sweet stuff is given up to greedy insects, then this good
work is not done; for the bees get disgusted, and stop
visiting the plants which do not take more pains to
please them. And so oftentimes the plant covers its
stem with hairs or with sticky drops, so that the meddlesome
little thieves cannot get up to the blossom at all.</p>

<p>So if you pick a flower which leaves your fingers
sticky, you must remember that the plant is only doing
its duty in trying to please the bees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span></p>

<p>Although I have seen these plants do so many queer
things that I am learning not to be surprised at their
clever ways, I must own that I was a little astonished
to see how anxious one of them was to save itself unnecessary
trouble.</p>

<p>There is a plant called the “amphibious knotweed.”
This is a rather difficult name, I know. This word
“amphibious” is applied to something that can live
both in water and on land; and this plant grows sometimes
in the pond or river, and sometimes on the shore.</p>

<p>When on land, its stem is covered with the hairs
which serve to keep meddlesome insects from climbing
up to its pretty balls of pink flowers. In the water
there is no danger of any such attack from insects; and
so when it happens to grow in the pond or river, this
knowing little plant does not trouble itself to clothe
with hairs its stem, but leaves this quite smooth.</p>

<p>Next summer I hope you will hunt up the amphibious
knotweed, and will compare the smooth water stem with
the hairy one that grows on land.</p>

<p>The delicate green stems die down to the ground
during the cold winter. Sometimes the whole plant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
dies, the root below as well as the stem above ground.
But often the root (or what we usually call the root)
lives, and sends up a fresh stem the next year.</p>

<p>But the woody stems live through the winter, and
put out fresh leaves and branches the next spring.</p>

<p>Without a magnifying glass, it is difficult to see of
just what the green stems of the small plants are made
up; and these you can pass by for the present. But
if your teacher will cut across the stem of a large rose,
you can see here an outer covering, <em>the green skin</em>;
within this, a <em>ring of woody material</em>; and in
the center of the stem, a <em>soft white stuff</em> called
“pith.”</p>

<p>When we were reading about seed leaves, I
told you that by the stem and leaves of a plant
you could tell whether it brought into the world
more than one seed leaf.</p>

<p>Now, when a stem like that of the rose is
divided into three well-defined parts,—the skin,
or bark, outside; next the woody part; and the
soft white pith in the middle,—then you can be
pretty sure that the plant had more than one seed leaf.</p>

</figure>

<p>This picture (Fig. <a href="#120">126</a>) shows you a section of a cornstalk.
Here you do not see the three parts that were
so plain in the rose stem, for the woody part is not
gathered together in a ring: it is scattered through the
soft part, so that you cannot distinguish the one from
the other.</p>

<p>Running lengthwise you see the scattered bundles of
woody threads, the cut ends of which give the dotted
look on top.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span></p>

<p>Now, such a stem as this of the corn shows you that
the plant was born with only one seed leaf.</p>

<p>Try to remember the difference between these two
stems.</p>

<p>This next picture (Fig. <a href="#121-1">127</a>) shows
a part of the trunk or stem of the fir
tree.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp20" id="121-1" style="max-width: 40.9375em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 127</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The dark outside circle is the bark.</p>

<p>The rings within this are the wood.
Each year one of these woody rings is
added to the tree, the last ring of all
lying next to the bark; so, if you count
these, you can find out how many years the tree has lived.</p>

<p>In the center we see the soft stuff called pith.</p>

<p>What do these three divisions show?</p>

<p>The trunk of the palm in the next picture (Fig. <a href="#121-2">128</a>) is
like the stem of the corn. The wood is not gathered in
rings, but is scattered through the soft part in thread-like
bundles, so that we cannot tell just the age of the tree.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 128</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>And what else do you know about the palm?</p>

<p>Why, you know that it came into
the world with but one seed leaf. If
it had had more than one, its stems
would have had woody rings such as
we see in the fir.</p>

<p>In the schoolroom you cannot see
palms and firs; but you can find a log
in a wood pile which will show you
just such woody rings as prove that the fir tree had
more than one seed leaf.</p>

<p>And you can look at a stalk brought from the cornfield<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
that will show you how the trunk of the palm tells
us that this tree began life with only one seed leaf.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="WELL_DONE_LITTLE_STEM">“WELL DONE, LITTLE STEM”</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">It</span> is wonderful how much there is to learn about
everything.</p>

<p>We began this book with an apple, and I had no
more idea than you that that apple was going to keep
us busy for days.</p>

<p>And then the apple reminded us of its cousins, the
pear and plum and peach and cherry and rose. And
if we had not stopped short, we should have been introduced
to so many more cousins that we should have
had neither room nor time for anything else.</p>

<p>From fruits we went to seeds.</p>

<p>At first it seemed almost as though we ought to
finish up the seeds in two or three readings; but this
did not prove to be the case.</p>

<p>The mere naming of the different ways in which
seeds went traveling, covered so many pages that it
was all we could do to find time to tell how a few of
the baby plants were cared for, and how they made
their way out of the seed shell into the world.</p>

<p>But when we came to roots, we felt there would be
no temptation to loiter by the way, for roots seemed
rather dismal things to talk about. Yet it took some
little time to show the different uses of a root, and to
talk about air roots and water roots, as well as earth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
roots. It was not altogether easy to make clear just
how the little root hairs keep acids on hand in which
to melt the solid earth food which their throats are too
delicate to swallow. And it was quite a long story
when we came to the dodder, which roots in the stems
of living plants, and steals all its food from them;
and to those orchids whose long roots swing from tree
branches and draw their nourishment from the air.</p>

<p>About stems, however, even I felt a little discouraged;
for though it is from the stem that all other parts of
a plant grow, yet it is not looked upon generally as
an interesting object when studied by itself; and I dare
say you children still feel that stems are less amusing
than fruits, or seeds, or roots.</p>

<p>Still we can hardly help admiring the way in which a
stem, when it lies underground, like that of the lily or
the Jack-in-the-pulpit, makes its food so carefully all
through the summer, and waits so patiently through the
long winter in order to help its plant to burst into flower,
and to ripen into fruit as soon as possible, and without
more labor and food hunting when the spring comes.</p>

<p>When a stem, like that of the morning-glory, sweeps
slowly and carefully through the air in search of something
to lay hold of in its efforts to climb upward, and
when, on finding this support, it makes such good use
of it, we feel inclined to say, “Well done, little stem.”</p>

<p>And when a stem on land knows how to keep off
meddlers, yet has the wisdom not to take unnecessary
trouble when afloat, like that of the amphibious knotweed,
then we feel that a plant gives its stem, as well
as its other parts, a large supply of common sense.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span></p>

<p>There is a great deal more that might be said on this
subject. What a plant lives on, what it eats and drinks
and breathes, is very interesting to learn about. And
of course the food taken in by the roots must be carried
upward through the stem. But to write simply about
this is difficult. As much as I think most of you can
understand, I will tell you when we take up leaves.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="BUDS_IN_WINTER">BUDS IN WINTER</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">When</span> school opened in September, all the trees
were covered with leaves; and some of these
trees were bent with their burden of pears and apples
and peaches, while others were hung with prickly chestnut
burrs or with acorns or walnuts.</p>

<p>But now all is changed. The woods look gray and
bare; for nearly all the leaves have fallen save those
of the oak, which are still holding fast to the branches.
These oak leaves are brown and stiff and leathery. They
crackle and rustle when the wind blows through them.</p>

<p>In the city squares you see the same change,—bare
branches in place of green leaves.</p>

<p>At this season it is hardly worth while, perhaps you
think, to go to the woods or to the park; for there is
nothing to be seen,—no leaves, no flowers, almost no
fruits. Better wait till spring for any such expedition.</p>

<p>Here you are wrong. Provided you know what to
look at, and how to look at it, there is no month of the
year when the woods and parks are not full of interest.</p>

<p>And so at this season, when the trees are bare of
leaves, better than at any other, certain things can be
studied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span></p>

<p>I have asked your teacher to bring to school to-day
branches from the different trees which are looking so
cold and lonely. It is nearly always possible to find
the horse-chestnut, the maple, or the cherry; and we
will talk especially about these branches.</p>

<p>On your way to school, perhaps you pass every day a
horse-chestnut tree; but its branches are so far above
your heads that you may never have noticed that in
winter the leafless twigs bear just such buds as you see
in the picture (Fig. <a href="#126">129</a>), and on the branch which is
before you.</p>

<p>The largest bud grows on top. This is where the
beautiful flower cluster that comes out in May lies
hidden.</p>

<p>The smaller buds that grow lower down the stem
hold only leaves. You see that these buds grow in
pairs, one bud opposite another, and always above a
sort of scar on the twig. This scar was made last
fall by the breaking-off of a leaf.</p>

<p>Perhaps you fancy that these buds have only just
made their appearance.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp10" id="126" style="max-width: 10.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/126.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 129</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>If you have any such idea as that, you are quite
wrong. Last summer, when the leaves were large and
fresh, the little buds, that were not to unfold for nearly
a year, began to form, growing somewhat larger as the
weeks went by, and folding themselves tightly in the
brown, leathery wrappings that were to keep them safe
from the cold of winter.</p>

<p>I should like you to pull off these wrappings, and
see how well the horse-chestnut tree defends from cold
its baby leaves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span></p>

<p>First you find about seven of these outside wrappings.
The very outer ones are thick and brown, and covered
with the sticky stuff that makes them proof against
rain.</p>

<p>The next ones are brown and thick where their tips
are exposed to the air, while the inner ones are green
and delicate. But altogether they make a warm, snug
covering for young leaves and flowers.</p>

<p>As for the baby leaves themselves, they are all done
up in a furry stuff that keeps them from catching cold,
even if a gust of wind or a few drops of rain should
manage to make a way through the waterproof and
almost air-tight wrappings.</p>

<p>So you see that the leaves and branches and young
flowers of a plant or tree are looked after just as carefully
as is the seed within the seed case, or the baby
plant in its seed shell.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Here</span> you see a branch from the red maple (Fig.
<a href="#127">130</a>).</p>

<p>On the flowering shoots three buds grow side by side.
The middle, smaller one holds the leaves. These leaves
do not appear until the two outer, larger buds have
burst into flower clusters; for the flowers of the red
maple appear before its leaves.</p>

<p>I want you to bring to school as many different kinds
of branches as you can find, and I hope you will examine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
them all very carefully. Notice the position of their
buds, and whether these grow close together or are scattered
far apart, and whether one bud grows just opposite
another; and look for the marks left by the leaves
which broke off last fall.</p>

<p>When the buds are large enough, you will find it
interesting to pull them apart (but you must do this
with great care) and see how beautifully wrapped are
the baby leaves and flowers.</p>

<p>I chose the branch of the horse-chestnut for special
examination, because its large buds show their contents
plainly.</p>

<p>When a bud grows on the tip of a stem, its work is to
carry on that stem; but when it grows just above a
leaf scar, you can be sure that it is a young branch.
Such a branch may bear either leaves or flowers, or
both.</p>

<p>But buds do not all grow up at the same time, or
necessarily at all.</p>

<p>The strongest ones are the first to open. The others
may keep quiet for some time, not unfolding, perhaps,
unless some of the earlier ones are killed. In this case,
the waiting buds try to fill the gap, and carry on the
good work of clothing the tree with leaves and flowers.</p>

<p>Sometimes they wait over till another year, and occasionally
a bud never opens at all.</p>

<p>You all enjoyed planting seeds, and watching them
grow under your very eyes.</p>

<p>Now I am going to propose to you a scheme which
has given me quite as much pleasure as my pot gardens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span></p>

<p>When the buds on the winter branches have swelled
the least little bit, after a few warm days in February
perhaps, go to the woods and cut several branches
in places where no one will miss them, and take them
home and put them in warm water, in a warm, bright
corner, and see what happens.</p>

<p>It will be a real joy to you, watching these little buds
get bigger and bigger, till the outer wrappings are
forced apart, and either thrown well aside, or pushed
off altogether; and you will be filled with delight when
the delicate baby leaves begin to stretch themselves, or,
better still, when the pure, beautiful flowers burst from
the brown, dead-looking twigs.</p>

<p>Get branches of cherry, apple, peach, and pear; and
bring in the pussy willow, the maple, the <em>Forsythia</em>, the
spicebush, and, if you can find it, the mountain laurel;
and if you do not pass many moments of almost breathless
pleasure watching the wonders these budding
branches are so eager to reveal, you are not the children
I take you to be.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="SOME_ASTONISHING_BUDS">SOME ASTONISHING BUDS</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">There</span> are some plants which do not put any
winter wraps on their delicate buds; and, strangely
enough, these buds do not seem to suffer for lack of
clothing.</p>

<p>In a warm country this would not surprise us. If we
were going to spend the winter in the West Indies, we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
should not carry our furs with us, for we should not
meet any weather cold enough to make them necessary;
and so perhaps in the West Indies the buds have no
more need of winter clothing than we ourselves.</p>

<p>But if we were to spend the Christmas holidays somewhere
in our Northern mountains, if we were going for
skating and coasting to the Catskills or the Adirondacks,
we should not fail to take with us our warmest
clothes.</p>

<p>And yet, if we walked in the Adirondack woods, we
should meet over and over again a shrub bearing naked
buds, their folded, delicate leaves quite exposed to the
bitter cold.</p>

<p>This shrub is the hobblebush, the pretty flowers of
which you see on p. <a href="#Page_246">246</a>.</p>

<p>I do not understand any better than you why this
hobblebush does not tuck away its baby leaves beneath
a warm covering. Neither do I understand how these
naked leaves can live through the long, cold winter. I
should like very much to satisfy myself as to the reason
for this, for they do live and flourish; and I wish that
such of you children as know the home of the hobblebush
(and it is common in many places) would watch
this shrub through the winter, and see if you can discover
how it can afford to take less care of its buds than
other plants.</p>

<p>There is one tree which seems to shield its buds more
carefully in summer than in winter. This tree is the
buttonwood. It grows not only in the country, but in
many of our city streets and squares. You know it by
the way in which its bark peels in long strips from its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
trunk and branches, and by the button-like balls which
hang from the leafless twigs all winter.</p>

<p>If you examine one of these twigs, now that they are
bare of leaves, you see the buds quite plainly; but if it
is summer time, when the leaves are clinging to the
branch, you see no buds, and suppose that they are not
yet formed.</p>

<p>But here you are wrong.</p>

<p>“How can that be?” you ask. You looked carefully,
and nowhere was there any sign of a bud.</p>

<p>But you did <em>not</em> look everywhere, after all.</p>

<p>If very carefully you had pulled off one of the leaves,
you would have found the young bud tucked safely
away beneath the hollow
end of the leafstalk. This
leafstalk fitted over it
more neatly than a candle
snuffer over a candle
(Fig. <a href="#131">131</a>).</p>

<figure class="figright illowp35" id="131" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/131.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 131</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Try this for yourselves
next summer. I think you
will be pleased with this
pretty arrangement.</p>

<p>We learned that the
potato, even though it is buried in the earth and does
not look like it, is really one of the thickened stems
of the potato plant.</p>

<p>The “eyes” of the potato look as little like buds as
the potato itself looks like a stem. Yet these “eyes”
are true buds; for, if we leave our potatoes in the dark
cellar till spring, the “eyes” will send out slender<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
shoots in the same way that the buds on the branches
of trees send out young shoots.</p>

<p>As I told you before, the usual place for a bud is
just between the stem and the leafstalk, or the scar left
by the leafstalk; but if a stem is cut or wounded, oftentimes
it sends out buds in other than the usual places.</p>

<p>This habit accounts for the growth of young shoots
from stumps of trees, and from parts of the plant
which ordinarily do not give birth to buds.</p>

<p>Some buds never open while fastened to the stem of
the parent plant; but after a time they fall to the
ground, strike root, and send up a
fresh young plant.</p>

<p>The tiger lily, the plant that grows
so often in old gardens, bears such
buds as these. We call them “bulblets”
when they act in this strange fashion.</p>

<p>Perhaps even more surprising than
this is the fact that leaves sometimes
produce buds.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp35" id="132" style="max-width: 44em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 132</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In certain warmer countries grows a plant called the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bryophyllum</i>. If you look carefully at the thick, fleshy
leaves of this plant, along its notched edges you will
see certain little dark spots; and if you cut off one of
these leaves and pin it on your window curtain, what do
you suppose will happen?</p>

<p>Well, right under your eyes will happen one of the
strangest things I have ever seen.</p>

<p>From the row of dark spots along the leaf’s edge,
springs a row of tiny, perfect plants (Fig. <a href="#132">132</a>).</p>

<p>And when these tiny plants are fairly started, if you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
lay the leaf on moist earth, they will send their roots
into the ground, break away from the fading leaf, and
form a whole colony of new plants.</p>

<p>Now, those dark spots along the leaf’s edge were tiny
buds; and the thick leaf was so full of rich food, that
when it was broken off from the parent plant, and all
of this food was forced into the buds, these were strong
enough to send out roots and leaves, and to set up in
life for themselves.</p>

<p>It will not be difficult for your teacher to secure some
of these leaves of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bryophyllum</i>, and to show you
in the schoolroom this strange performance.</p>

<p>All children enjoy wonderful tricks, and I know of
nothing much prettier or more astonishing than this
trick of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bryophyllum</i>.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">To-day</span> we begin to learn what we can about
the leaves of plants. I hope that enough fresh
green leaves have been brought to school to allow
every child here to have one on the desk before him,
so that he may see, as far as is possible, just what
is being talked about.</p>

<p>This picture (Fig. <a href="#135">133</a>) shows you the leaf of the
quince. Now, suppose you held in your hand a leaf
fresh from the quince tree, and were
asked to describe it to a blind person,
how would you tell about it?</p>

<figure class="figright illowp25" id="135" style="max-width: 40.875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/135.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 133</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>You would begin, I fancy, by saying,
“This leaf is green,” for the color of
an object is one of the things we notice
first.</p>

<p>Next perhaps you would describe its
shape. “This quince leaf is rounded,
yet it is too long to be called a round
leaf.” So you would use the word
“oblong.”</p>

<p>Like most leaves, then, it is green; and like some
other leaves, it is oblong.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span></p>

<p>Now look at this picture (Fig. <a href="#136">134</a>) of the maple leaf.
This, you see, is not oblong, but three-pointed.</p>

<p>What other differences do you notice between these
two leaves?</p>

<p>You do not seem quite sure as to whether there are
any other differences. But do you not notice that the
edge of the maple leaf is cut into little teeth, like the
edge of a saw, while the edge of
the quince leaf is smooth?</p>

<p>And let me tell you here, that
when I speak of a leaf, I speak
not only of the enlarged flat
surface we call the “leaf blade,”
but also of the “leafstalk.” A leaf
usually consists of a leafstalk and
a leaf blade, though some leaves
are set so close to the stem that
they have no room for any stalks
of their own.</p>

<p>“Oh! then,” you answer, “the
leafstalk of the maple is much
longer than that of the quince, and there are little bits
of leaves at the foot of the quince leafstalk which the
maple is without.”</p>

<p>You have done very well, and have noticed just
those things which you should.</p>

<p>The shape of the leaf blade, whether the edge of this
is toothed, the length of the leafstalk, and whether this
has any little leaves at its foot where it joins the stem,
are things always worth noticing.</p>

<p>Now take your leaves and hold them up against the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
light, or else look at the picture of the quince leaf, and
study carefully the make-up of the blade.</p>

<p>You see that this is divided lengthwise by a heavy
rib which juts out on the lower side. From this
“midrib,” as it is called, run a great many smaller lines.
These are called “veins.” And from these branch off
still smaller veins that bear the name of “veinlets.” And
somewhat as the paper is stretched over the sticks of a
kite, so from the leaf’s midrib to its edge, and from vein
to vein, is drawn the delicate green material which
makes up the greater part of the leaf.</p>

<p>What I wish you to learn this morning is, <em>how to look
at a leaf</em>.</p>

<p>Before using our brains rightly, we must know how
to use our eyes. If we see a thing as it really is, the
chances are that our thoughts about it will be fairly
correct.</p>

<p>But it is surprising how often our eyes <em>see wrong</em>.</p>

<p>If you doubt this, ask four or five of your playmates
to describe the same thing,—some street accident, or a
quarrel in the playground, which all have seen, or
something of the sort,—and then I think you will
understand what I mean by saying that few people see
correctly.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="THE_MOST_WONDERFUL_THING_IN_THE">THE MOST WONDERFUL THING IN THE
WORLD</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">It</span> would be quite a simple matter to interest you children
in plants and their lives, if always it were
possible to talk only about the things which you can
see with your own unaided eyes.</p>

<p>I think a bright child sees better than many a grown
person, and I think that it is easier to interest him in
what he sees.</p>

<p>And then plants in themselves are so interesting
and surprising, that one must be stupid indeed if he
or she finds it impossible to take pleasure in watching
their ways.</p>

<p>But about these plants there are many things which
you cannot see without the help of a microscope, and
these things it is difficult to describe in simple words.
Yet it is necessary to learn about them if you wish
really to feel at home in this beautiful world of plants.</p>

<p>After all, whatever is worth having is worth taking
some trouble for; and nothing worth having can be had
without trouble. So I hope when you children come
to parts of this book that seem at first a little dull, you
will say to yourselves, “Well, if we wish really to know
plants, to be able to tell their names, to understand
their habits, we must try to be a little patient when we
come to the things that are difficult.”</p>

<p>For even in your games you boys have to use some
patience; and you are quite willing to run the risk of
being hurt for the sake of a little fun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span></p>

<p>And you girls will take no end of trouble if you
happen to be sewing for your dolls, or playing at
cooking over the kitchen stove, or doing something to
which you give the name “play” instead of “work.”</p>

<p>I only ask for just as much patience in your study
of plants; and I think I can safely promise you that
plants will prove delightful playthings long after you
have put aside the games which please you now.</p>

<p>So we must begin to talk about some of the things
which you are not likely to see now with your own
eyes, but which, when possible, I will show you by
means of pictures, and which, when you are older, some
of you may see with the help of a microscope.</p>

<p>Every living thing is made up of one or more little
objects called “cells.”</p>

<p>Usually a cell may be likened to a tiny bag which
holds a bit of that material which is the most wonderful
thing in the whole world, for this is the material which
has <em>life</em>.</p>

<p>Occasionally a cell is nothing but a naked bit of this
wonderful substance, for it is not always held in a
tiny bag.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp25" id="139" style="max-width: 38.125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/139.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 135</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This picture (Fig. <a href="#139">135</a>) shows you a naked plant cell,
much magnified, that swims about in
the water by means of the two long
hairs which grow from one end of the
speck of life-giving material.</p>

<p>The next picture (Fig. <a href="#140">136</a>) shows
you a seed cut across, and so magnified
that you can see plainly its many cells.</p>

<p>In the middle portion of the seed the cells are six-sided,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
and laid against one another in an orderly and
beautiful fashion, while the outer ones are mostly round.</p>

<p>All animals, we ourselves, all plants, began life as a
single cell.</p>

<p>Sometimes a cell will spend its life alone. When the
time comes for it to add to the life of the world, it
divides into two or more “daughter cells,” as they are
called. These break away from one
another, and in like manner divide
again.</p>

<p>But usually the single cell which
marks the beginning of a new life
adds to itself other cells; that is, the
different cells do not break away
from one another, but all cling together,
and so build up the perfect
plant or animal.</p>

<p>By just such additions the greatest
tree in the forest grew from a
single tiny cell.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp25" id="140" style="max-width: 48.0625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/140.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 136</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>By just such additions you children have grown to
be what you are, and in the same way you will continue
to grow.</p>

<p>Every living thing must eat and breathe, and so all
living cells must have food and air. These they take
in through their delicate cell walls. The power to do
this comes from the bit of living substance which lies
within these walls.</p>

<p>This strange, wonderful material within the little cell
is what is alive in every man and woman, in every boy
and girl, in every living thing, whether plant or animal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span></p>

<p>We know this much about it, and not the wisest man
that ever lived knows much more.</p>

<p>For though the wise men know just what things go
to make up this material, and though they themselves
can put together these same things, they can no more
make life, or understand the making of it, than can
you or I.</p>

<p>But when we get a good hold of the idea that this
material is contained in all living things, then we begin
to feel this; we begin to feel that men and women,
boys and girls, big animals and little insects, trees and
flowers, wayside weeds and grasses, the ferns and rushes
of the forest, the gray lichens of the cliffs and fences,
the seaweeds that sway in the green rock pools, and
living things so tiny that our eyes must fail to see
them,—that all these are bound into one by the tie of
that strange and wonderful thing called life; that they
are all different expressions of one mysterious, magnificent
idea.</p>

<p>While writing that last sentence, I almost forgot that
I was writing for boys and girls, or indeed for any one
but myself; and I am afraid that perhaps you have
very little idea of what I am talking about.</p>

<p>But I will not cross it out. Why not, do you suppose?</p>

<p>Because I feel almost sure that here and there among
you is a girl or boy who will get just a little glimmering
idea of what I mean; and perhaps as the years go by,
that glimmer will change into a light so bright and clear
as to become a help in dark places.</p>

<p>But the thought that I hope each one of you will carry
home is this,—that because this strange something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
found in your body is also found in every other living
thing, you may learn to feel that you are in a way
a sister or brother, not only to all other boys and girls,
but to all the animals and to every plant about you.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="HOW_A_PLANT_IS_BUILT">HOW A PLANT IS BUILT</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Now</span> we know that the plant, like yourself, began
life as a single cell; and we know that the perfect
plant was built up by the power which this cell had of
giving birth to other cells with like power.</p>

<p>Suppose that a brick were laid upon the earth as the
foundation of a wall; and suppose that this brick were
able to change into two bricks. Suppose that the new
brick were able to form another brick in the same manner,
and that this power should pass from brick to
brick; and suppose that all these bricks were able to
arrange themselves one upon another in an orderly
fashion, so that they could not easily be moved from
their places.</p>

<p>Now, if you can see this brick wall growing up, you
can see something of how the cells of a plant grow
up and arrange themselves.</p>

<p>But though it is fairly easy to see how the plant
cells form one from another, that does not explain how
they come to make a plant, with its many different
parts, with its root and stem, its branches, leaves, and
flowers.</p>

<p>One thing can divide and make two things of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
same sort; but it is not easy to see how it can make
things that are quite different from itself.</p>

<p>Now, if this difficulty as to the building-up of plants
and animals has come into your minds, you are only
puzzled by what has puzzled hundreds of people before
you; and all these hundreds of people have found the
puzzle quite as impossible to solve as the king’s horses
and the king’s men found it impossible to put Humpty
Dumpty together again.</p>

<p>A good many questions that we cannot answer come
into our minds; but if we look honestly for the answers
and do not find them, then we can be pretty sure that
for the present it is safe to leave them unanswered.</p>

<p>As cell is added to cell in the building-up of plant life,
some wonderful power forces each new cell to do the
special work which is most needed by the growing plant.</p>

<p>Sometimes this new cell is needed to help do the
work of a root, and so it begins to do this work, and becomes
part of the root; or else it is needed to do stem
work, and goes to make up the stem, or leaf work, and
is turned over into the leaf.</p>

<p>A healthy cell is born with the power to do whatever
is most needed.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="HOW_A_PLANTS_FOOD_IS_COOKED">HOW A PLANT’S FOOD IS COOKED</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Some</span> time ago we learned that the little root hairs,
by means of their acid, are able to make a sort
of broth from the earthy materials which they could
not swallow in a solid state.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span></p>

<p>But before this broth is really quite fit for plant
food, it needs even more preparation.</p>

<p>Why do we eat and drink, do you suppose?</p>

<p>“Because we are hungry.” That is the direct reason,
of course. But we are made hungry so that we
shall be forced to eat; for when we eat, we take into
our bodies the material that is needed to build them
up,—to feed the cells which make the flesh and bone
and muscle.</p>

<p>And this is just why the plant eats and drinks. It
needs constantly fresh nourishment for its little cells,
so that these can live, and grow strong enough to
make the new cells which go to form, not bone and
flesh and muscle, as with you children, but fresh roots
and stem and leaves and flowers and fruits.</p>

<p>If these little cells were not fed, they would die, and
the plant would cease to live also.</p>

<p>And now what do you think happens to the broth
that has been taken in from the earth by the root
hairs?</p>

<p>As we have said, this broth needs a little more preparation
before it is quite fit for plant food. What it
really wants is some <em>cooking</em>.</p>

<p>Perhaps you can guess that the great fire before
which all plant food is cooked is the sun.</p>

<p>But how are the hot rays of the sun to pierce the
earth, and reach the broth which is buried in the plant’s
root?</p>

<p>Of course, if it remains in the root, the earth broth
will not get the needed cooking. It must be carried
to some more get-at-able position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span></p>

<p>Now, what part of a plant is usually best fitted to
receive the sun’s rays?</p>

<p>Its leaves, to be sure. The thin, flat leaf blades are
spread out on all sides, so that they fairly bathe themselves
in sunshine.</p>

<p>So if the broth is to be cooked in the sun, up to
the leaves it must be carried.</p>

<p>And how is this managed? Water does not run
uphill, as you know. Yet this watery broth must
mount the stem before it can enter the leaves.</p>

<p>Water does not run uphill ordinarily, it is true; yet,
if you dip a towel in a basin of water, the water rises
along the threads, and the towel is wet far above the
level of the basin.</p>

<p>And if you dip the lower end of a lump of sugar
in a cup of coffee, the coffee rises in the lump, and
stains it brown.</p>

<p>And the oil in the lamp mounts high into the wick.</p>

<p>Perhaps when you are older you will be able somewhat
to understand the reason of this rise of liquid in
the towel, in the lump of sugar, in the lamp wick. The
same reason accounts partly for the rise of the broth
in the stem. But it is thought that the force which
sends the oil up the wick would not send the water
far up the stem. And you know that some stems are
very tall indeed. The distance, for example, to be
traveled by water or broth which is sucked in by the
roots of an oak tree, and which must reach the top-most
leaves of the oak, is very great.</p>

<p>Yet the earth broth seems to have no difficulty in
making this long, steep climb.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span></p>

<p>Now, even wise men have to do some guessing
about this matter, and I fear you will find it a little
hard to understand.</p>

<p>But it is believed that the roots drink in the earth
broth so eagerly and so quickly, that before they know
it they are full to overflowing. It is easier, however,
to enter a root than it is to leave it by the same door;
and the result is, that the broth is forced upward into
the stem by the pressure of more water or broth behind.</p>

<p>Of course, if the stem and branches and leaves
above are already full of liquid, unless they have some
way of disposing of the supply on hand, they cannot
take in any more; and the roots below would then be
forced to stop drinking, for when a thing is already
quite full to overflowing, it cannot be made to hold
more.</p>

<p>But leaves have a habit of getting rid of what they do
not need. When the watery broth is cooked in the sun,
the heat of the sun’s rays causes the water
to pass off through the little leaf mouths.
Thus the broth is made fit for plant food,
and at the same time room is provided for
fresh supplies from the root.</p>

<p>If you should examine the lower side of
a leaf through a microscope, you would
find hundreds and thousands of tiny
mouths, looking like the little mouths in this picture
(Fig. <a href="#146">137</a>).</p>

<p>Some of the water from the earth broth is constantly
passing through these mouths out of the plant, into
the air.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">It</span> is all very well, you may think, to say that the
pressure from the root sends the water up through
the stem; but when we cut across such a stem as a tree
trunk, one finds it full of wood, with a little tightly
packed soft stuff in the center, and not hollow like a
water pipe, as one would suppose from all that has been
said about the way the water rises in the stem.</p>

<p>No, a stem is not a hollow pipe, or even a bunch of
hollow pipes, it is true; and it does seem something of
a question, how the water can force its way through all
this wood; and even if one hears how it is done, it is
not an easy thing to make clear either to grown people
or to children. But I will see what I can do; and I know
that you really love these plants and trees, and will try
to be a little patient with them and with me.</p>

<p>The water, or liquid, when it mounts a stem or tree
trunk, takes a path that leads through the new-made
cells. Each young cell wall is made of such delicate
material that it allows the water, or broth, to filter
through it, just as it would pass through a piece of thin
cloth. And so it makes its way from cell to cell, along
the stem, more slowly than if it were passing through a
hollow tube, but almost as surely. It is true, the earth
broth does not reach the leaves above without having
given up something to the little cells along the road.
These seem to lay hold of what they specially need
for their support, while the rest is allowed to pass on.</p>

<p>I want your teacher to prove to you by a little experiment
that water makes its way up a stem.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span></p>

<p>If she will place in colored water the stem of a large
white tulip, cutting off its lower end under the liquid,
those parts whose little cells are in closest connection
with the stem will soon begin to change color, taking
the red or blue of the water; for a freshly cut stem has
the same power as the root to suck in water eagerly and
quickly.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="HOW_A_PLANT_PERSPIRES">HOW A PLANT PERSPIRES</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">We</span> cannot see the water as it passes from the tiny
leaf mouths into the air. Neither can we see
the water that is being constantly carried from the surface
of our bodies into the air. But if we breathe against
a window pane, the scattered water in our breath is
collected by the cold of the glass in a little cloud; and
if we place the warm palms of our hands against this
window pane, in the same way the cold collects the
water that is passing from the little mouths in our skin,
and shows it to us as a cloud on the glass.</p>

<p>Heat scatters water so that we cannot see it, any
more than we can see the lump of sugar when its little
grains are scattered in hot water; but cold gathers
together the water drops so that we are able to see them.</p>

<p>This is why you can “see your breath,” as you say,
on a cold day. The cold outside air gathers together
the water which was scattered by the heat of your body.</p>

<p>If you place against the window pane the under side
of the leaves of a growing plant, the water passing
from the tiny leaf mouths collects on the glass in just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
such a damp cloud as is made by the moist palms of
your warm hands.</p>

<p>When water passes from your hands, you say that
you are perspiring; and when water passes away from
the plant, we can say that the plant perspires. Some
plants perspire more freely than others. A sunflower
plant has been known to give off more than three
tumblers of water a day by this act of perspiration.</p>

<p>There is a tree, called the <em>Eucalyptus</em>, whose leaves
perspire so freely that it is planted in swampy places in
order to drain away the water.</p>

<p>Of course, the more quickly the leaves throw off
water, the faster the fresh supply pushes up the stem.</p>

<p>If the leaves do their work more quickly than the
roots make good the loss, then the plant wilts.</p>

<p>When a leaf is broken from a plant, it soon fades.
Its water supply being cut off, it has no way of making
good the loss through the leaf mouths.</p>

<p>Just as the air in a balloon keeps its walls firm, so the
water in the leaf cells keeps the cell walls firm.</p>

<p>As a balloon collapses if you prick it with a pin, and
let out the air, so the cell walls collapse when the cells
lose their water; and when the cell walls of a leaf collapse,
the leaf itself collapses.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">We</span> see that the water is drawn away from the
earth broth into the air by the heat of the sun,
just as water is drawn from the broth we place on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
stove by the heat of the fire; and that when this has
happened, the plant’s food is cooked, and is in condition
to be eaten.</p>

<p>But this broth does not lose all its water. There is
still enough left to carry it back through the leaf into
the branches and stem, and even down into the root
once more.</p>

<p>In fact, the prepared food is now sent to just those
parts of the plant which most need it.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is laid up beneath the bark, to help make
new buds which will burst into leaf and flower another
year.</p>

<p>Or perhaps it goes down to help the roots put out
new branches and fresh root hairs.</p>

<p>Or possibly it is stowed away in such an underground
stem as that of the lily, or the crocus bulb, and is
saved for next year’s food. Once in a while some of
this prepared food is stored in the leaf itself.</p>

<p>When a leaf is thick and juicy (“fleshy,” the books
call it), we can guess that it is full of plant food.</p>

<p>Do you recall the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bryophyllum</i>,—the plant we talked
about a few days ago? Its wonderful leaves, you remember,
gave birth to a whole colony of new plants.</p>

<p>You may be sure that these leaves had refused to
give up all the food sent to them for cooking in the
sun. You can guess this from their thick, fleshy look,
and you can be sure of this when you see the baby
plants spring from their edges; for without plenty of
nourishment stored away, these leaves could never manage
to support such a quantity of young ones.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">But</span> the earth broth which the roots supply is not
the only article of importance in the plant’s bill
of fare.</p>

<p>The air about us holds one thing that every plant
needs as food.</p>

<p>This air is a mixture of several things. Just as the
tea we drink is a mixture of tea and water, and milk
and sugar, so the air is a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen,
and water and carbonic-acid gas.</p>

<p>Oxygen, nitrogen, and carbonic-acid gas,—each one
of these three things that help to make the air is what we
call a gas, and one of these gases is made of two things.
Carbonic-acid gas is made of oxygen and carbon.</p>

<p>Now, carbon is the food which is needed by every
plant. But the carbon in the air is held tightly in the
grasp of the oxygen, with which it makes the gas called
carbonic-acid gas.</p>

<p>To get possession of this carbon, the plant must
contrive to break up the gas, and then to seize and
keep by force the carbon.</p>

<p>This seems like a rather difficult performance, does
it not? For when a gas is made of two different
things, you can be pretty sure that these keep a firm
hold on each other, and that it is not altogether easy
to tear them apart.</p>

<p>Now, how does the plant meet this difficulty?</p>

<p>You cannot guess by yourselves how this is done, so
I must tell you the whole story.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span></p>

<p>Certain cells in the plant are trained from birth for
this special work,—the work of getting possession of
the carbon needed for plant food. These little cells
take in the carbonic-acid gas from the air; then they
break it up, tearing the carbon from the close embrace
of the oxygen, pushing the oxygen back into the air it
came from, and turning the carbon over to the plant
to be stored away till needed as food.</p>

<p>Only certain cells can do this special piece of work.
Only the cells which hold the green substance that
colors the leaf can tear apart carbonic-acid gas. Every
little cell which holds a bit of this leaf green devotes
itself to separating the carbon from the oxygen.</p>

<p>Why this special power lies in a tiny speck of leaf
green we do not know. We only know that a cell
without such an occupant is quite unable to break up
carbonic-acid gas.</p>

<p>But even the bit of leaf green in a tiny cell needs
some help in its task. What aid does it call in, do you
suppose, when it works to wrench apart the gas?</p>

<p>In this work the partner of the bit of leaf green is
nothing more or less than a sunbeam. Without the
aid of a sunbeam, the imprisoned leaf green is as
helpless to steal the carbon as you or I would be.</p>

<p>It sounds a good deal like a fairy story, does it not,—this
story of Leaf Green and Sunbeam?</p>

<p>Charcoal is made of carbon. About one half of
every plant is carbon.</p>

<p>The coal we burn in our fireplaces is the carbon left
upon the earth by plants that lived and died thousands
of years ago. It is the carbon that Leaf Green and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
Sunbeam together stole from the air, and turned over
into the plant.</p>

<p>If one looks at a piece of coal with the eyes which
one keeps for the little picture gallery all children carry
in their heads, one sees more than just a shining, black
lump. One sees a plant that grew upon the earth
thousands of years ago, with its bright green leaves
dancing in the sunlight; for without those green leaves
and that sunlight, there could be no coal for burning
to-day. And when we light our coal fire, what we
really do is to set free the sunbeams that worked their
way so long ago into the plant cells.</p>

<p>It is more like a fairy story than ever. Sunbeam is
the noble knight who fought his way into the cell where
Leaf Green lay imprisoned, doomed to perform a task
which was beyond her power. But with the aid of
the noble Sunbeam, she did this piece of work, and
then both fell asleep, and slept for a thousand years.
Awakening at last, together they made their joyful
escape in the flame that leaps from out the black
coal.</p>

<p>In truth, a sunbeam and a flame are not so unlike
as to make this story as improbable as many others
that we read.</p>

<p>And because I have told it to you in the shape of
a fairy story, you must not think it is not true. It
is indeed true. Everywhere in the sunshiny woods
and fields of summer, the story of Leaf Green and
Sunbeam is being lived. But when the day is cloudy
or the sun sets, then there is no Sunbeam to help the
Princess, and then no carbon is stolen from the air.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="PLANT_OR_ANIMAL">PLANT OR ANIMAL?</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Did</span> you ever stop to ask yourself, “What is the
difference between a plant and an animal?”
because this is the place where that question should
be answered.</p>

<p>“Why, an animal is <em>altogether</em> different from a
plant,” you answer, perhaps a little scornfully. “I
have no trouble in telling which is which.”</p>

<p>It is very natural that you should feel this way.
A cow or a horse, for example, is not at all like a
tree; and when you think of animals, you think of
the ones you know best, and likewise of plants.</p>

<p>But wise men have discovered plants that look and
act so much like animals, and animals that look and
act so much like plants, that at one time they say,
“Now, these are animals, surely,” and a little later
exclaim, “No, after all, these are plants;” and they
take a long time to make up their minds as to whether
certain objects are plants or animals.</p>

<p>And already even you children have discovered that
the plants you know best belong to families, and have
children, and care for them in a very motherly fashion;
that they drink earth food with their roots, and eat
carbon food with their leaves; and soon you will find
that they do many other things which once upon a
time you would have thought it a great joke to be
told a plant could do.</p>

<p>You remember my telling you of one little plant
cell that could swim; and there are some animals,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
you know, that are rooted to one spot as we usually
think only a plant is rooted.</p>

<p>What, then, <em>is</em> the difference between a plant and
an animal?</p>

<p>Leaf Green and Sunbeam between them put life
into what had no life before; and the living plant
matter, which they help to make, is that which animals
cannot make themselves, yet which they cannot live
without, for this living matter is absolutely necessary
to them as food.</p>

<p>And the one real difference between a plant and an
animal is this,—a plant can make out of certain dead
substances the living matter that all animals must have
for food; an animal cannot do this.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="HOW_WE_ARE_HELPED_BY_LEAF_GREEN">HOW WE ARE HELPED BY LEAF GREEN
AND SUNBEAM</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> cell in which Leaf Green lives has no little
mouths such as we saw in the picture some time
ago.</p>

<p>Its walls are so delicate that the carbonic-acid gas
passes through them quite easily,—as easily as the
gas escaping from an unlighted jet in the schoolroom
could pass to your nose even if you wore a veil, or as
easily as water would pass through a piece of muslin.</p>

<p>But between Leaf Green’s cell and the outer air are
other cells,—those which make up the outer covering
or skin of the leaf. These are arranged so as to form
the openings or mouths about which we have read. By
means of these mouths the gas makes its way through
the leaf’s thick skin.</p>

<p>The plant needs as food the carbon in this gas,
and so keeps fast hold of it; but the oxygen is not
needed for this purpose, and so it is pushed back into
the air.</p>

<p>Now, we learned in the last chapter of one very great
service rendered to animals by plants. We learned that
plants took carbon from the air, and turned this into
food for animals.</p>

<p>But there is still another way in which plants serve
animals. And once more it is the work of Leaf Green
and Sunbeam that is of such importance to us; for
when they take hold of the carbon, making it into
living food for man and beast, they take from the air<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
the gas that is poisonous, and send back into the air
the gas which gives life and health.</p>

<p>This poisonous gas which they lay hold of, you remember,
is carbonic-acid gas; and carbonic-acid gas is
what we animals send out of our bodies with every
breath, for it is the part of the air which poisons us.
When the schoolroom is so close that our heads ache,
it is because so many children have been breathing out
this gas, and we are forced to take it back into our
bodies again.</p>

<p>But when this gas is stolen by the plant, and robbed
of its carbon, it is no longer carbonic-acid gas. Nothing
of it is left but the oxygen which is pushed out
through the cell walls; and this oxygen is as good to
breathe as the other gas (carbon and oxygen mixed)
is bad.</p>

<p>So the plant finds good what we find poisonous. It
takes in and keeps that which hurts us (the carbon), and
sends out that which helps us (the oxygen).</p>

<p>So you see that our lives depend on the lives of plants
in two ways:—</p>

<p>1. The plants give us the food we need for life.</p>

<p>2. The plants take from the air the gas that poisons
us, and give to the air the gas which we need for life
and health.</p>

<p>And in both cases it is Leaf Green and Sunbeam who
are making life possible for us.</p>

<p>Remember the great services of these two fairies
when next you pass a green tree which is bathing itself
in sunshine.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="HOW_A_PLANT_BREATHES">HOW A PLANT BREATHES</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Perhaps</span> you have heard people say that it is not
good to sleep in a room with plants.</p>

<p>They say this, because they have heard that at night
the plant does not give out oxygen, but that it does
give out the poisonous carbonic-acid gas.</p>

<p>Now, you children know that part of this statement
is true.</p>

<p>You know that the plant cannot give out oxygen at
night, because at that time there is no Sunbeam about
to help Leaf Green tear apart carbonic-acid gas and
send the oxygen back into the air.</p>

<p>But how about the other part of the statement?</p>

<p>Is it true that at night plants give out the poisonous
carbonic-acid gas?</p>

<p>Both day and night, plants give out carbonic-acid gas;
for though plants, save in the sunlight, cannot eat by
means of their little green cells, they can breathe
through the tiny mouths (Fig. <a href="#146">137</a>) on the under side
of the leaf by night as well as by day.</p>

<p>And when either a plant or an animal breathes, it
takes the life-giving oxygen from out the air mixture,
and keeps it for its own use. But poisonous carbonic-acid
gas is sent back into the air. Now, the question is,
whether a plant does most good or most harm to the air
by taking in and sending out the different gases.</p>

<p>Of course, it does good when it lets the oxygen out
through its cell walls, and stores away the carbon within
itself; and it may seem to do harm when through its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
leaf mouths it breathes in oxygen and breathes out
carbonic-acid gas.</p>

<p>There is only one key to unlock the matter, and that
is this,—to find out whether the plant does most
towards poisoning or towards purifying the air.</p>

<p>And that has been found out already.</p>

<p>Wise men say that Leaf Green and Sunbeam do
much more good to the air than the little breathing
mouths do harm. The two good fairies take away a
great deal of poison, and send back a great deal of the
helpful oxygen; while the tiny mouths neither rob the
air of much oxygen nor give it much poison. Indeed,
the harm they do is so small compared with the
great good accomplished by Leaf Green and Sunbeam,
that even at night you need not worry at the thought
that you have plants in your room.</p>

<p>Perhaps you wonder that a plant does these two
things that are so exactly opposite to each other.</p>

<p>But a plant must breathe as well as eat; for when it
breathes, it takes in the precious oxygen which is just
as necessary to its life as to ours.</p>

<p>In summer, by the dusty roadside, you see plants
almost white with dust, looking quite ill and lifeless.</p>

<p>And they are both ill and lifeless; for their little leaf
throats are so choked that they cannot breathe in the
oxygen they need, and in consequence they are being
slowly suffocated.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="THE_DILIGENT_TREE">THE DILIGENT TREE</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Now</span> we have learned three things about plants,
and especially about leaves. We have learned—</p>

<p>1. That they perspire.</p>

<p>2. That they eat and drink.</p>

<p>3. That they breathe.</p>

<p>They perspire when the water passes through the
leaf mouths into the air.</p>

<p>They eat when Leaf Green and Sunbeam together
manage to take the carbon out of the carbonic-acid gas
which has made its entrance through the leaf mouth
and the cell wall. They drink when the roots suck in
water and earth broth.</p>

<p>They breathe when the leaf mouths take from the air
the oxygen, and give back to it carbonic-acid gas.</p>

<p>The veins and veinlets, of which you see so many
running through a leaf, act in something the same way
as the water pipes of a city; for through these veins
the watery food, the earth broth, is carried to the different
cells.</p>

<p>When one knows all that we know even now about
a plant, one looks at a tree covered with leaves with a
good deal of admiration.</p>

<p>Just think of what is being done inside that quiet-looking
tree! Think of the millions of cells that go
to make it up, each cell having its own work to
do! Think of the immense amount of business being
carried on within the trunk, inside the branches, and
especially in each green leaf! And when you have the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
chance, notice how hard each leaf tries to get just as
much sun and air as it possibly can.</p>

<p>In the first place, the thin, flat leaf blades are so
spread out that every part is exposed to the light
and air.</p>

<p>Then notice how the leaves are placed in reference
to one another.</p>

<p>Almost every single one is fastened to the tree so
as to get its fair share of sunshine.</p>

<p>When you think of the many thousands of leaves
borne by one tree, it astonishes you to see how seldom
one leaf gets in another’s light.</p>

<p>And the shapes of leaves are always suited to their
arrangement on the tree.</p>

<p>If you should take the leaves of a chestnut tree and
replace them by the leaves of a maple, you would
find the maple leaves all getting in each other’s way, or
else you would see that they were taking up a great
deal more room than necessary.</p>

<p>But when a leaf is studied on its own tree, one sees
that its shape is the very best that could be imagined
for its position.</p>

<p>And in the smaller plants we notice this same thing.</p>

<p>And when you remember that Leaf Green cannot
feed the plant unless Sunbeam comes to her assistance,
you realize how necessary it is that each leaf be within
the reach of Sunbeam’s visits.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="LEAVES_AND_ROOTS">LEAVES AND ROOTS</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">You</span> will be surprised to learn that the way in which
a plant’s leaves grow tells us something of the
way in which its roots grow.</p>

<p>Many of you have been overtaken far from home in
a rainstorm, and have sought shelter under a spreading
tree. The ground directly beneath the tree has kept
almost dry even after some hours of rain, but the
earth just under the tips of the spreading branches got
very wet: for the great tree acted like a large umbrella;
and when the raindrops fell upon the smooth leaves,
which sloped outward and downward, they rolled from
leaf to leaf till they reached the very lowest, outermost
leaves of all. From these they fell to the ground, just
as the drops that gather upon your umbrella run outward
and downward to the umbrella’s edge, and then
off upon the ground.</p>

<p>So you can see that the circle of earth which marks
the spread of the branches above must be specially wet,
as it received a great part of the rain which fell upon
the whole tree.</p>

<p>And whenever you see a tree which sheds the rain
water in such a circle, you can be pretty sure that, if
you should dig into the earth a ditch which followed
this circle, you would soon reach the tips of the new
root branches of the tree.</p>

<p>You know that the root does the drinking for the
plant; and only the newest parts of the root, the fresh
root tips, are really good for work of this sort. You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
remember that the earth food is carried up the stem to
the leaves in a watery broth; and that if the water
supply should give out, the new plant cells would not
get the broth which helps them to grow, and to put out
other cells, and so to build up the plant.</p>

<p>Now, as only the new root branches, near their tips,
are able to drink, if the water should leak through
the earth in equal quantities
everywhere, much of it would
be wasted; but when this
water is collected in certain
spots within reach of the new
root branches, there is good
reason to believe that these
will be able to satisfy their
thirst.</p>

<p>By the shedding of the rain
from the tips of the spreading
branches above, the water is
collected in a ring, and so
sinks into the earth; and the
root branches below spread
out in just the same direction
as the tree branches above, till they find what they
need, and drink their fill.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp35" id="163" style="max-width: 45.375em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 138</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>So by the way in which a tree sheds the rain, you
can tell just where its root branches reach out underground.</p>

<p>In smaller plants you see much the same thing.
Fig. <a href="#163">138</a> shows a plant called the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Caladium</i>. You can
see that the raindrops must roll outward down these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
leaves, and fall upon the earth just above the tips of
the root branches.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#164">139</a> shows you the rhubarb plant. This has
quite a different sort of root. Now, if the rhubarb
leaves were like those of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Caladium</i>, unless
the rhubarb root-branches
changed their direction, these
root-branches would grow very
thirsty indeed.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp35" id="164" style="max-width: 41.3125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/164.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 139</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But as it is, the water pours
down these leaves toward the
center of the plant, and reaches
the ground almost directly over
the straight, fleshy root, with
its downward-growing branches;
and we see that these root-branches
are watered by the
leaves above just as carefully as
are those of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Caladium</i>.</p>

<p>By knowing one thing about
a plant, often you can guess
that another thing is so.</p>

<p>You understand now that when the leaves of a plant
shed rain water after the fashion of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Caladium</i>, the
chances are that its root-branches spread out as far
as the drip of the water; and that the root of the
rhubarb points almost straight downward, is told you
by the drip of water from the rhubarb leaves.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Some</span> time ago you learned that
from the stem of a plant you
could guess the number of seed leaves
which it brought into the world, and
that in the same way from the seed
leaves you could guess what kind of a
stem it would build up.</p>

<p>From the way in which a leaf is
veined you can guess both of these
things. You can guess what sort of a
stem belongs to the plant, and with how
many seed leaves it began life.</p>

<p>When the little veins run in and out,
forming a sort of network, we say
that the leaf is “net-veined.”</p>

<p>These leaves of the quince (Fig. <a href="#165-1">140</a>), the maple (Fig.

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span></p>

<p>Net-veined leaves are borne by plants which brought
into the world more than one seed leaf; and with the
net-veined leaf we can expect to find that
stem which comes with more than one seed
leaf,—a stem where the skin or bark, the
woody rings, and the soft central pith, are
clearly separated one from another.</p>

<p>But a leaf such as that in Fig. <a href="#166-1">143</a> or that
in Fig. <a href="#166-2">144</a>, where the veins do
not branch off in a network, but
run in unbroken lines side by
side,—such leaves as these tell
you that they are borne by plants
which started life with only one seed leaf,
and which have such a stem as the cornstalk,
where you see no woody rings or
central pith.</p>

<p>These leaves are called “parallel-veined.”</p>

<p>I fear that you find all this a little difficult
to understand and to remember; but if you read it
patiently, when you study the botany for older children,
I think it will come back to you and make your lessons
easier.</p>

<p>I should like to know how many of you
children, without looking even at a picture
save such as you carry in that little gallery
in your head, could describe correctly
the shapes of some of our
common leaves. I should like to
ask you to draw on the blackboard
the rough outlines of any leaves
that you remember. If you think
you could not do this, will you not
try, when next you see a leaf, to
carry off in your mind such a picture
of it as to enable you to outline<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
it on the blackboard when you go back to the school
room?</p>

<p>Really it does not take any more time to see a thing
correctly than to see it incorrectly. It takes a little
more sense, that is all.</p>

<p>It takes some sense to give even one minute of
honest thought to the thing you are looking at.</p>

<p>You know some children who never seem to have
all their thoughts in one place at a time, and who in
consequence never see anything really well.</p>

<p>It is better to stop doing a thing altogether than
to do it in a foolish sort of way; and it is foolish to
start to do even the smallest thing, and yet not do it.</p>

<p>The child who looks at even a leaf in a way to
make it possible for him to draw the outline of that
leaf five minutes later, is likely to be the child who
goes in for both work and play with all his heart, and
who comes out as far ahead on the playground as he
does in the schoolroom.</p>

<p>Now, after that lecture, which some of you need
badly enough (and which I will tell you, as a great
secret, I need not a little myself), I want to point out
a few more of the things that are worth noticing in a
leaf.</p>

<p>But perhaps it is better to save them for another
chapter.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="HAIRY_LEAVES">HAIRY LEAVES</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Notice</span> always whether a leaf is smooth or hairy.
Do you remember the mullein that sends up
its tall spires over the hill pasture? The grayish
leaves of this mullein are so hairy that they feel
almost like wool. What is the use of all this hair?
It is not likely that a plant would wrap itself in this
hairy coat except for some good reason.</p>

<p>It is believed that this coating of the mullein prevents
animals from eating the leaves, and so destroying
the plant. In the mouth, these hairs slip from
the leaf blade, and cause a most unpleasant sensation.</p>

<p>But usually the hairs on a leaf are helpful because
they prevent too much perspiration or giving-off of
water. The more freely the hot sun beats upon a
leaf, the more quickly the water is drawn away from
it. You can see just how this is by hanging a wet
towel in front of the fire. In a very short time the
heat from the burning coals draws the water from
the towel. But put a screen between the fire and
the towel, and the water passes off more slowly.</p>

<p>Now, the hairs on that side of the leaf which faces
the sun act as a screen from its fierce heat. We have
learned how important it is that the leaf should not
part with its water more quickly than the roots can
make up the loss. We know that when a leaf does
this, it wilts just as a leaf wilts when it is picked and
cut off from its water supply, on account of the collapse
of the walls of the many little cells which are
emptied of water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span></p>

<p>So you can understand that plants which grow in
dry, sunny places, where there is little drinking water
for the roots, and where the sun beats constantly on
the leaves, must take every care that there is no
waste of water.</p>

<p>And if you keep your eyes open, you will discover
that many of the plants which grow in such places
screen themselves from the full heat of the sun by a
coat of hairs.</p>

<p>The plant called “life everlasting” is one which
grows in dry, open, sunny places. It clothes its leaves
with silky hairs, and so prevents them from throwing
off too quickly the small amount of water its roots
are able to provide. Without this silky coat, the sun
would suck its leaves quite dry of water.</p>

<p>Sometimes a leaf has only a few of the little leaf
mouths through which most of the water passes. As
these mouths are wide open only in the sunlight, and
as often the rest of the leaf is covered with a thick
skin which prevents the water from slipping away (as
a little of it nearly always does) through the cell walls,
such a leaf will hold its water supply and keep fresh
for a long time. Such leaves as these we find on what
we call “evergreen” plants. The pines and hemlocks
which light up the woods all winter have these thick-skinned,
few-mouthed leaves, which throw off so little
water that even when the ground is frozen hard, and
gives no drinking water to the roots, they are able to
keep fresh by the careful way in which each one
hoards its own little supply.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="WOOLLY_AND_DUSTY_LEAVES">WOOLLY AND “DUSTY” LEAVES</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Curiously</span> enough, some plants put on a hairy
coat for just the opposite reason from the
one which makes life everlasting clothe itself in that
fashion. Life everlasting fears lest its leaves throw
off their water, or perspire too quickly.</p>

<p>Down by the stream that runs through the meadow
grow great clusters of the pink-flowered steeple bush.
If you look at the lower sides of the leaves of the
steeple bush, you see that they are very woolly. As
this wool is not between the sun and the leaf blade,
it cannot be meant to protect the leaves from the
heat of the sun; and indeed in this wet meadow,
close to the river, never mind how quickly the leaves
throw off their water, the roots can have no difficulty
in finding close by more than enough to make good
the loss. No, the fact is that these leaves need to
throw off water very freely indeed to make room for
the ever-fresh supply that is pushing up the stem,
and their woolly covering is intended to help them
do this very thing. Its object is to aid perspiration.
In swampy places the moisture rises every night from
the wet ground, and settles on the plants about. The
little mouths on the under surfaces of the leaves of
the steeple bush would soon be clogged with the moisture
rising from below, if they were not protected in
some way; and if they became so clogged, they could
not throw off the water with which the whole plant is
charged. Thus, by having this thick coat of hair, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
water that otherwise would cling to the outer surface
of the leaf blade is kept at a distance from the little
mouths, and these are not interrupted in the performance
of a duty so necessary to the health of the
plant.</p>

<p>This same habit of coating its lower leaf surfaces
with hair, you notice in the speckled or swamp alder, a
shrub which grows also in wet places, and therefore
runs the same risk of having its leaf mouths clogged
with water.</p>

<p>So when you see only the upper surface of a leaf
covered with hair, you can guess that the object of the
plant is to prevent too much perspiration; but when
you see only its lower side clothed in this same way,
you can guess that the plant fears too little perspiration.</p>

<p>Sometimes you find a plant with leaves which have a
coating of what looks almost like dust on one or both of
their surfaces. This dust we call “bloom.” We see it
in apples and grapes, as well as on leaves. It is made
up of a waxy material which is put forth by the plant
just as it puts forth hair. This bloom the plant uses
also as a help to free perspiration. By thus clothing its
leaves it shields the little mouths from water clogging;
and so you can be sure that the little mouths have not
been filled with water, and thus prevented from doing
their work.</p>

<p>The cabbage leaf has mouths on both of its surfaces,
and so both sides are covered with this protecting bloom.
If you dip a cabbage leaf in water and then shake it, the
drops roll off and leave it quite dry.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Leaves</span> need to
protect themselves
from other enemies than
too great heat and too
much water.</p>

<p>We found that the prickly
armor of the thistle enabled it to
live in pastures where the cattle had
killed most of the other plants.</p>

<p>Many animals like to eat green
leaves, so we are not surprised to
find that plants invent different
ways of protecting themselves.</p>

<p>One look at the leaf of the thistle
is enough to persuade us that it
would not be very good eating.</p>

<p>The red-berried holly,
with which we decorate
our churches and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
houses at Christmas time, is another plant with prickly
leaves.</p>

<p>Some plants cover their leaves with bristles, which
the cattle dread almost as much as the stout prickles.</p>

<p>As we read before, the mullein defends its leaves by
a fuzzy coat of hair. Such an armor as this is less
warlike than that of the thistle, but quite as effective.</p>

<p>Other plants fill their leaves with juices which are
either poisonous or unpleasant.</p>

<p>It seems as if animals guessed the presence of these
unfriendly juices by the plant’s smell, for they will
munch the different growing things all about such a
plant as this, and leave the harmful leaves severely
alone.</p>

<p>The nettles cover their leaves with stinging hairs.
These stiff hairs break off when handled, burying themselves
in the flesh, and sending out a burning acid that
punishes severely the meddler, man or beast, as it may
happen to be.</p>

<p>By this time I think you realize that leaves are well
worth noticing. And when you have looked at a leaf
so fully as to be able to carry in your mind its outline,
I hope you will then discover whether it wears a coat of
hair, or a dusty bloom, or a prickly armor, or a thick,
evergreen skin, and that you will decide what enemies
it is trying to escape.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Have</span> you ever seen a leaf like the one in this
picture (Fig. <a href="#176">152</a>)?</p>

<p>It is shaped something like a pitcher; and the plant
on which it grows has been named the “pitcher plant.”</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp40" id="176" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/176.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 152</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The pitcher plant lives in low, wet
place, such as the shaded swamp, or
the marsh down by the lake.</p>

<p>On account of its curious leaves
it is brought to the cities, and is
sold on the street corners or at
the florists’.</p>

<p>In June comes the great
flower of the pitcher plant. Sometimes
this is a dull red; again it is a delicate pink
or perhaps a light green; and it has faint, pleasant
fragrance.</p>

<p>Next June I hope that some of you children will
find these beautiful flowers and these curious leaves.</p>

<p>Why should a leaf be shaped like a pitcher, do you
suppose?</p>

<p>These leaves are not only pitcher-like in shape, but
also in their way of holding water; for if you succeed
in discovering a settlement of pitcher plants, you will
find that nearly every pitcher is partly filled with rain
water. Usually this water is far from clear. It appears
to hold the remains of drowned insects; and
sometimes the odor arising from a collection of these
pitcher plants is not exactly pleasant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span></p>

<p>Perhaps you wonder how it happens that dead insects
are found in every one of these pitchers; and possibly
you will be surprised to learn that apparently these
curious leaves are built for the express purpose of
capturing insects.</p>

<p>It is easy to understand that these odd leaves are not
so well fitted as more simple ones to cook the plant’s
food in the sun, or to take carbon from the air; but if
they are unfitted to provide and prepare ordinary food,
possibly they are designed to secure food that is
extraordinary.</p>

<p>It seems likely that the pitcher plant is not content
to live, like other plants, upon the simple food that is
taken in from the earth and from the air. We are led
to believe that it wishes something more substantial;
that it needs a <em>meat</em> diet; and that to secure this, it
teaches its leaves to capture flies and insects in order
that it may suck in their juices.</p>

<p>These leaves are veined in a curious and striking
fashion. The bright-colored veins may convince the
insects of the presence of the sweet nectar in which they
delight. At all events, in some way they are tempted
to enter the hollow leaf; and, once they have crawled
or tumbled down its slippery inner surface, they find it
impossible to crawl back again, owing to the stiff hairs,
pointing downward, which line the upper part of the
pitcher.</p>

<p>Even if they have wings, it is difficult for them to fly
upward in so straight a line as would be necessary to
effect their escape.</p>

<p>When tired out in their efforts to get out of this cruel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
trap, they fall into the water at the bottom of the
pitcher, and are drowned. Their bodies decay and dissolve;
and it is thought that this solution is taken in by
the leaf, and turned over to the plant as food.</p>

<p>It is just the old, sad story of the spider and the fly,
you see, only now it is the pitcher and the fly.</p>

<p>But be sure to examine one of these pitchers if you
possibly can, and then you will understand better how
the whole thing is managed.</p>

<p>The leaf in this picture (Fig. <a href="#178">153</a>),
for it is a leaf, you cannot find in our
North American swamps. It grows
on a plant called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nepenthes</i>, a plant
which lives in hot countries far from
the United States.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp30" id="178" style="max-width: 41.125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/178.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 153</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The leaf in the picture is full
grown, and all ready for its work of
trapping animals. Before it was old
enough to do this, the lid which is
now lifted was laid nicely across the
opening to the pocket, and so prevented any unseasonable
visits.</p>

<p>Sometimes these pockets are so large as to be able to
hold and to hide from sight a pigeon. They are gayly
colored, and the rim around their border is covered with
a sugary, tempting juice. So you can guess that the
animals in search of nectar are not slow in accepting
the invitation offered by color and sweets, and that some
of these are imprudent enough to venture across the
sticky edge. In this event they are pretty sure to lose
their footing on the slippery inner surface of the pocket,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
and to fall into the watery liquid with which it is filled.
Even if they do not slip immediately, their efforts to
crawl back over the rim are defeated by a row of teeth
such as you see in the picture.</p>

<p>The liquid at the bottom of the leaf is not rain water,
as in the pitcher plant. It is given out by the leaf
itself; and it contains an acid which dissolves the
animals’ bodies, so that their more nourishing parts can
easily be taken in by certain little cells which line the
lower part of the pocket, and which have been brought
up to this work.</p>
<br>

</figure>
<br>

<p>The next picture (Fig. <a href="#179">154</a>) shows you a water plant.
It is called the “bladderwort,” because of the little bags<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
or bladders which you see growing from the branches
under water. The little bladders are traps set for water
animals, which swim into them in their wish, perhaps,
to escape some enemy. But they are quite unable to
swim out again; for the door into the bladder is transparent,
and looks like an open entrance with a nice
hiding place beyond. It opens easily from the outside,
but is so arranged that it will not open from within.
So when the poor little animal hurriedly swims into
what seems to it a cozy resting spot, and draws a long
breath of relief at getting safe inside, it is hopelessly
caught, and must slowly starve to death, for there is no
chance of escape. It may live for nearly a week in this
prison; but at last it dies. Its body decays, and is
taken in as food by the cells set apart for that purpose.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, though we ourselves do not hesitate
to kill animals for food, and sometimes, I am sorry
to say, for nothing but amusement, we give a little
shiver of disgust when we find these plants doing the
same thing. Some lines that came out in one of the
magazines a few years ago express this feeling:—</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> plants about which we read in the last chapter
do not take any active part in capturing insects.
They set their traps, and then keep quiet. But there
are plants which lay hold of their poor victims, and
crush the life out of them in a way that seems almost
uncanny.</p>

<p>This leaf (Fig. <a href="#181">155</a>) belongs to a plant which lives
in North Carolina. It is called Venus’s
flytrap.</p>

<p>You see that the upper, rounded part
of the leaf is divided by a rib into two
halves. From the edges of these
rounded halves run out a number of
long, sharp teeth; and three stout bristles
stand out from the central part of
each half. When an insect alights upon
this horrible leaf, the two halves come
suddenly together, and the teeth which
fringe their edges are locked into one another
like the fingers of clasped hands.</p>

<p>The poor body that is caught in this cruel trap is
crushed to pieces. Certain cells in the leaf then send
out an acid in which it is dissolved, and other cells
swallow the solution.</p>

<p>After this performance the leaf remains closed for
from one to three weeks. When finally it reopens, the
insect’s body has disappeared, and the trap is set and
ready for another victim.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span></p>

<p>The next picture (Fig. <a href="#182-1">156</a>) shows you a little plant
which is very common in our swamps,—so common
that some of you ought to find it without
difficulty next summer, and try upon it
some experiments of your own.</p>

<p>It is called the “sundew.” This name
has been given to it because in the sunshine
its leaves look as though wet with
dew. But the pretty drops which sparkle
like dew do not seem so innocent when you
know their object. You feel that they
are no more pleasing than is the bit of
cheese in the mouse trap.</p>

<p>When you see this plant growing
in the swamp among the cranberry
vines and the pink orchids, you
admire its little white flowers, and its round red-haired
leaves, and think it a pretty, harmless thing. But bend
down and pluck it up, root and all, out of the wet,
black earth. Carry it home with you, and, if you have
a magnifying glass, examine one of its
leaves.</p>

<p>The picture (Fig. <a href="#182-2">157</a>) shows you a
leaf much larger than it is in life. The
red hairs look like pins stuck in a
cushion, and the head of each pin glistens
with the drop that looks like dew.</p>

them to be the sweet nectar for which they long, and
they climb or light upon the leaves in this belief.</p>

<p>The red hairs close slowly but surely over the insect
whose legs are already caught and held fast
by the sticky drops it mistook for nectar,
and they hold it imprisoned till it dies and
its juices are sucked in by the leaf.</p>

<p>I should like you to satisfy yourselves
that these leaves act in the way I have described.
But a bit of fresh meat will excite
the red hairs to do their work quite as
well as an insect, and I hope in your
experiments you will be merciful as well
as inquiring.</p>

<p>So you see that the little sundew is quite
as cruel in its way as the other insect-eating
plants. But its gentle looks seem to
have deceived the poet Swinburne, who wonders
how and what these little plants feel, whether like
ourselves they love life and air and sunshine.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="THE_FALL_OF_THE_LEAF">THE FALL OF THE LEAF</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">You</span> know that in autumn nearly all the leaves fall
from the trees. To be sure, a few trees (such as
the pines and hemlocks) and some plants (such as the
laurel and wintergreen and partridge vine) do hold fast
their leaves all winter; but these are so few as compared
with the many plants which lose their leaves,
that they hardly count.</p>

<p>Perhaps you never stopped to wonder why most
plants get rid of their leaves before winter comes on;
but you feel pretty sure now that there is some good
reason for a habit that is adopted by nearly all the
plants that live in this part of the country.</p>

<p>When we were talking about the way in which
leaves defend themselves from different dangers, we
found that evergreen leaves, the leaves which hold fast
to the tree and keep fresh all winter, manage to keep
their water safe inside their cells by wearing a very
thick skin, and by not having too many little leaf
mouths. For when a leaf has a thin skin and a great
many mouths, its water leaks away very quickly. And
if many such leaves should remain upon a plant into
the winter, might it not happen that they would let
off all its water at a time when its roots could not find
any more in the frozen ground? And thus might not
the leaves kill the plant by draining it quite dry?</p>

<p>So you can see why it is well for most plants to
shed their leaves before winter comes on and the root’s
drinking water is turned into ice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span></p>

<p>But when a plant is about to shed its leaves, it takes
care not to waste the precious food which they hold.
This food it draws back into its stem and roots, laying
it away in safe places beneath the buds which are to
burst another year.</p>

<p>It is this action on the part of the plant which
changes the color of the leaves every fall. That material
which makes them green is broken up, and part
of it is taken away. That which is left is usually
yellow or brown or reddish, and gives the leaves the
beautiful colors we see in our October woods.</p>

<p>So whenever you see the woods changing color,
losing their fresh green and turning red and yellow,
you can be sure that the trees have begun to prepare
for winter. You know that they are stowing away
their food in warmer, safer places than can be supplied
by the delicate leaves. And when all the food has
been drawn out of the leaves, and packed away in
the right spots, then the plant finishes a piece of work
it began some time before. This piece of work is the
building-up of a row of little cells just where the leafstalk
joins the stem or branch. When this row is complete,
it acts almost like a knife, loosening the stalk
from the stem.</p>

<p>Then the leaf’s life work is over; and with the first
breeze, the empty shell, which is all that is left, breaks
away from the parent plant, and drifts earthward.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="THE_BUILDING_PLAN_OF_THE_CHERRY">THE BUILDING PLAN OF THE CHERRY
BLOSSOM</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">One</span> day your teacher brought to school a branch
broken from the cherry tree. This she placed
in water, standing the tumbler on the sunny window
sill; and now its buds have burst into a glory of white
blossoms.</p>

<p>To-day I want you to study the flower of the cherry;
for if you know all about this flower, which is put
together in a rather simple way, one that is easy to
study, it will not be so difficult for you to understand
other, less simple flowers.</p>

<p>You may wonder why I do not wait till the cherry
tree outside is in blossom; but if we waited till May,
other flowers, which are not built on quite so simple a
plan, would have come and gone, and you would not
have been able to understand them so well as if you
had first studied the simple make-up of the cherry
blossom.</p>

<p>Last fall we learned a little about this flower, but we
had only its picture to help us in our work: so I think
it well to begin all over again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span></p>

<p>In looking at the cherry blossom (Fig. <a href="#188">160</a>), we
should first notice the green cup which holds the rest
of the flower.</p>

<p>This cup is divided into five green leaves.</p>

<p>During the babyhood of the flower, when it was
quite too young to face the cold, windy world, these
green leaves were folded together so as to shut away
from all harm its more delicate parts.</p>

<p>Above this green cup we see a circle made up of five
white leaves. These pretty leaves are spread outward
as if they were quite proud of themselves, and eager to
attract attention.</p>

<p>And that is just what they are trying
to do; for the cherry blossom is
not wise enough to know that here in
the schoolroom there are no bee visitors
to bring it yellow dust, and to
help it grow into a cherry. These
leaves are the little handkerchiefs
which the cherry tree, just like the apple tree we
read about long ago, uses in signaling the bees.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp25" id="188" style="max-width: 40.125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/188.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 160</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Within the circle of white leaves you see a quantity
of what we named “pins with dust boxes.” You remember
that these dust boxes hold the powdery material
which is as wonderful as Cinderella’s fairy godmother
in its power to do strange and surprising things.</p>

<p>And in the very center of the flower you find a
single “pin,” as we called it, with a flat top which is not
a dust box.</p>

<p>But you remember that at the foot of this pin is
another sort of box, a seedbox (Fig. <a href="#189">161</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span></p>

<p>And you have not forgotten that it is on the flat
top of this pin that the bee brushes the yellow dust
which gives new life to the seed below, and turns the
little case of the seedbox into the juicy cherry.</p>

<p>So now what do we find in the cherry blossom?
We find</p>

<p>1. A green cup cut above into separate leaves.</p>

<p>2. A circle of white leaves.</p>

<p>3. Some pins with dust boxes.</p>

<p>4. One pin with a seedbox.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp20" id="189" style="max-width: 31.0625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/189.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 161</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Here you have the plan on which the cherry
blossom is built (for flowers, like houses,
are built on different plans), and the building
plan of the cherry blossom is one of the
simplest of all. So it is well, before studying
more difficult flowers, to feel quite at
home with this one. And you must try
to remember first what work each part of the flower
is expected to perform; for you see that the leaves
of the green cup, the pretty white leaves, the pins
with dust boxes, and the pin with a seedbox, have
each and all their special task,—a task which they
alone are able to accomplish.</p>

<p>Now, in talking about a flower it is troublesome
to use a great many words where one would answer
every purpose, so I will tell you what these different
parts of the flower have been named; and by taking
a little trouble to remember these names, we can
save a good deal of time.</p>

<p>The green cup is called the “calyx.”</p>

<p>“Calyx” is a Greek word meaning “cup.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span></p>

<p>The circle of leaves which grow above the green
cup or calyx is called the “corolla.”</p>

<p>“Corolla” comes from a word which means “crown.”</p>

<p>The pins with dust boxes are called “stamens.”</p>

<p>“Stamen” comes from a word meaning “to stand.”</p>

<p>The pin with a seedbox is called the “pistil.”</p>

<p>“Pistil” is another form of the word “pestle.” A
pestle is an instrument used in the drug shops for
pounding and mixing medicines. You might ask to
look at one the next time you are sent to the drug
shop, and then you can see for yourselves if it really
looks like its namesake, the pin with a seedbox.</p>

<p>Perhaps at first you may find it a little difficult
to bear in mind these four words with their meanings;
but soon they will become quite easy, and will save
you much trouble.</p>

<p>Green cup,—calyx.</p>

<p>Circle of flower leaves,—corolla.</p>

<p>Pins with dust boxes,—stamens.</p>

<p>Pin with seedbox,—pistil.</p>

<p>If you remember the names of these four parts of
the flower, how the different parts look, and what
they do, you will have made a good start in the
study of flowers.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="LILIES">LILIES</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">I <span class="upper-case">think</span> most of you know by sight at least one
of the three following flowers.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp35" id="191-1" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/191-1.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 162</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I have asked for pictures of three
different kinds of lilies, so
that the city and country
children alike may
recognize an old
friend; for every
spring the white Easter
lily (Fig. <a href="#191-1">162</a>) stands outside
the flower shops, and decorates
the churches, and travels
through the streets in the peddler’s cart; while in
summer time the country is bright with the wood
and meadow lilies (Figs. <a href="#191-2">163</a>, <a href="#192-1">164</a>).</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp20" id="191-2" style="max-width: 41.4375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/191-2.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 163</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>And I hope that even now one of
the living blossoms is before you, for
I want you to see for yourselves what
plan these lilies use in flower building.</p>

<p>The building plan of the cherry,
you remember, began with a green
cup or calyx.</p>

<p>Do you find in the lily any green
cup?</p>

<p>No, there is nothing of the sort in
the lilies. You see only a circle of
flower leaves. In the last chapter you learned to call
such a circle the corolla. But the wise men say that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
without a calyx there cannot be a real corolla. So
in the lily we will speak of the “flower leaves” instead
of the corolla.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp20" id="192-1" style="max-width: 33.9375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/192-1.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 164</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Next we find six of the pins with dust
boxes, or the stamens.</p>

<p>And then we come to the pin with a
seedbox below, or the pistil.</p>

<p>So the building plan of the lily has only
three divisions:—</p>

<p>1. Flower leaves.</p>

<p>2. Stamens.</p>

<p>3. Pistil.</p>

<p>If you look at the lower side of the outer row of
flower leaves, you will see that they are
streaked with green; and that when the
flower is still in bud, only the green,
thick parts of these leaves are exposed
to the wind and cold, while the more
delicate parts of the blossom are hidden
almost as snugly as though they were
covered by the leaves of a green cup
or calyx.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp25" id="192-2" style="max-width: 27.625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/192-2.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 165</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>These lilies are pleasant flowers to
study. Their different parts are so
large and simple that you have no
doubt as to what they are meant for.
The bees could hardly overlook their
great, showy handkerchiefs; and the
heaping dust boxes must powder the
visiting bees so freely with golden or
brownish dust, that plenty of this is sure to be carried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
to the pistil of a neighboring blossom; and the flat tip
of this pistil is so large and so sticky, that, once the dust
is brushed upon it, it is sure to stay there until its
wonderful work is accomplished.</p>

<p>The gay tulip (Fig. <a href="#192-2">165</a>) is a cousin to the lily.
It is built on almost the same plan. There is no
green cup in the tulip; but every tulip has</p>

<p>1. Flower leaves.</p>

<p>2. Stamens.</p>

<p>3. Pistil.</p>

<p>The tip of the tulip’s pistil is divided into three parts.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="ABOUT_STAMENS">ABOUT STAMENS</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Let</span> us take a good look at the stamens of the
Easter lily. There are six of these. Each dust
box is fastened to the tip of a tall stalk. Fig. <a href="#193-1">166</a>
shows you a single stamen from the Easter lily. It is
drawn somewhat larger than life. Its box has opened,
and is letting out some grains of dust.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp10" id="193-1" style="max-width: 12.8125em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 166</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>There are many different kinds of stamens. I will
show you some pictures that will give you an idea
of their great variety. Here is one taken from the
flower of the shin leaf (Fig. <a href="#193-2">167</a>). The dust makes its
escape through two little openings at the very top of
the box.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp10" id="193-2" style="max-width: 8.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/193-2.jpg" alt="">

</figure>

<p>That shown in Fig. <a href="#194-1">168</a> is from the barberry. The
sides of the box open like a door which is hinged on
top. This arrangement lets out a quantity of dust.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span></p>

<p>Here is a collection of stamens of different sorts.
Fig. <a href="#194-2">169</a> has two boxes at the top of its stalk,
and so has Fig. <a href="#194-4">171</a>. Fig. <a href="#194-5">172</a> has a crosspiece,
with a good-sized box at one end, and
only the little beginnings of a box at the
other. Fig. <a href="#194-3">170</a> has a similar crosspiece, with
a box at one end only.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp20" id="194-1" style="max-width: 20.3125em;">

<p>You see that flower faces show quite as
much variety as do the faces of the people
you know. You must not expect to find stamens all
alike, any more than you would expect all the boys and
girls you know to have noses of the
same shape, or hair of the same color.</p>

<p>This picture (Fig. <a href="#194-6">173</a>) shows you all the stamens of
the pea blossom. Do you notice that quite a number
of these (nine, in fact) grow together close
about the pistil, while the tenth one stands
alone? That is a strange custom always
observed by the stamens of the pea.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 174</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Next we see all the stamens from one of
the tiny flowers of the golden-rod (Fig. <a href="#194-7">174</a>).
These are very much larger than life. There
are five of them, fastened together in a sort
of tube. Split open this tube and flatten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
it out. Now they look like five little sisters, arm in
arm (Fig. <a href="#195-1">175</a>).</p>

<p>And here, again joined in a tube, we see the stamens
of the mallow (Fig. <a href="#195-2">176</a>). From the hollow of this tube
stand out the tops of the mallow’s pistils.</p>

<p>Some flowers have so many stamens that you would
find it almost impossible to count them. This little
blossom (Fig. <a href="#195-3">177</a>), the enchanter’s nightshade (drawn
much larger than life), has only two.</p>

<p>I hope that you children, from now on, will be unwilling
to pass by a flower without looking to see
whether its stamens are few or many; and I hope
you will try to carry away in your minds a clear idea
of the size and shape of their dust boxes.</p>

<p>The next picture (Fig. <a href="#197-1">183</a>)
shows you a group of dust
grains from flowers of different kinds, one looking
like a porcupine, another like a sea shell, another like
some strange water animal, and all, I fancy, quite
unlike any idea you may have had as to the appearance
of a grain of flower dust.</p>

<p>When you are older, I hope it may be your good luck
to see through a microscope some of the odd shapes and
curious markings of different kinds of flower dust, or
“pollen,” as this flower dust is called in the books.</p>

<p>And now that you know something of the appearance
of flower dust, perhaps you wish to learn a little
more of the way in which it helps the flower to
turn into the fruit.</p>

</figure>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">But</span> first you must know a little something about
the pistil, if I am really to make clear to you
how the flower dust helps the flower to change into
fruit.</p>

<p>This picture (Fig. <a href="#197-2">184</a>) shows you the pistil of the
lily. At the foot of this pistil, you remember, is the
box which holds the lily’s seeds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span></p>

<p>The top of the lily’s pistil is quite large and somewhat
flat. It is almost as sticky as if it had received
a dab of glue.</p>

<p>This flat top dwindles below into a stalk, which
grows larger again at its lower end.</p>

<p>Now take a sharp knife and cut open lengthwise
this pistil.</p>

<p>The lower, thicker part, seen through a magnifying
glass, looks like Fig. <a href="#198">185</a>. You see a great many baby
seeds fastened to a central wall. Each one of these
seeds holds a speck of the wonderful material without
which there is no life. But this speck of life has not
the power to make the seed grow into a plant. To do
this, the seed must have some outside help; and this
help can come only from a grain of flower dust.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp8" id="198" style="max-width: 12.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/198.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 185</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Perhaps you wonder how a dust grain brushed on
the pistil’s flat top can ever reach the baby seeds
hidden away in the seedbox.</p>

<p>I could not tell you to-day how this is done were
it not for those wise and patient men and women who
have spent days and weeks and months, and even
years, in watching and studying the ways of plants.</p>

<p>But first let me ask you a question.</p>

<p>What happens when a healthy seed falls on moist
ground?</p>

<p>Why, it seems to take in the moisture, and to thrive
upon it. It swells up, and at last it bursts open, and
it sends a root down into the earth.</p>

<p>Now, something not altogether unlike this happens
when a lily dust grain falls upon the moist tip of a
lily pistil. The dust grain sucks in the moisture. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
grows bigger and bigger. The outer skin becomes too
small for the swelling contents. At last it bursts open,
letting out a little tube.</p>

<p>This little tube works its way down through the
stalk of the pistil, almost as a root pushes down into
the earth, and at last it reaches one of the seeds in
the seedbox below.</p>

<p>And into this tiny seed the little tube pushes its way.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp10" id="199-1" style="max-width: 14em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/199-1.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 186</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The tube has carried with it that speck of wonderful
living material which every dust grain holds.
And when this living speck has been added to that
which the seed already holds, a great change begins
to come about.</p>

<p>This new touch of life, added to that already present,
gives the lily seed the power to grow into a lily plant.</p>

<p>The other dust grains that were brushed upon the
flat top of the lily’s pistil act in just the same way.
Apparently without difficulty the different tubes find
their way to the different seeds, till at last each one
has received the fresh touch of life without which
it cannot grow into a lily plant.</p>

<p>I cannot show a lily dust grain in the act of
sending out its life-bearing tube; but above is
a dust grain (Fig. <a href="#199-1">186</a>) from the thorn apple.
You see that it has burst open, and that a tube
is pushing its way out.</p>

<p>This picture (Fig. <a href="#199-2">187</a>) is that of a pistil seedbox
cut open, showing you a tube that is working
its way from the dust grain above to a tiny
seed in the seedbox below.</p>

<p>As I told you in the last chapter, the name “pollen”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
has been given to this wonder-working flower dust. A
grain of flower dust is a grain of pollen.</p>

<p>In many flowers you will find a pistil much like the
one that you see in the lily.</p>

<p>But there are as many different kinds of pistils as
there are different kinds of stamens.</p>

<p>This pistil (Fig. <a href="#Page_200">188</a>) is from the grass of Parnassus,
that pretty white flower which you find in the wet
meadows in August and September. It has no real
stalk, you see, like that of the lily; but it is quite thick
all the way from top to bottom. In Fig. <a href="#Page_200">189</a> it is cut
across, showing the seeds inside.</p>

<p>Many pistils that are joined in one piece below, where
the seeds are held, separate above into two or more
parts. Fig. <a href="#Page_200">190</a> shows the seed holder of a saxifrage,
divided into two pieces above; Fig. <a href="#Page_200">191</a> gives that of
the Saint John’s-wort, separating into three parts; that
of the sundew (Fig. <a href="#Page_200">192</a>) separates into six parts.
Fig. <a href="#Page_200">193</a> is a section of the pea flower. This is cut
lengthwise so as to show you the seeds which line the
inner surface of the pistil. Here you have the baby
pea pod.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span></p>

<p>All these flowers have only one real pistil,—one
pistil which may persuade you, by the way in which it
separates above, into thinking that there are
more than one. So you must be on your
guard in this respect, and remember that
flowers have a way of playing tricks with
all but the most wide-awake of boys
and girls. Look long and carefully
before you declare that a flower has
only one pistil.</p>

<p>Here we see half of a buttercup
(Fig. <a href="#201-2">194</a>). The buttercup has a great
many entirely separate pistils. Look
sharply at the picture,
and you will see them crowded
upon the little thimble-shaped object
in the middle of the blossom.
Do not confuse them with the
stamens, for the buttercup has also
a great many stamens. When buttercup
time comes round, I want
every one of you to look at these many pistils and
stamens.</p>

<p>The next picture (Fig. <a href="#201-3">195</a>) shows you a
strawberry. In the strawberry blossom the
pistils are so small, and so crowded, and so
hidden by the many stamens, that it is not
easy to see them; and so I show you the full-grown
berry, with little pistils scattered all over
its surface. Each of those tiny objects which
stand out on the strawberry is a separate pistil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span></p>

<p>Whenever you look at a flower, I want you to
remember that its bright flower leaves will soon fade
and fall, and that its stamens will lose their pollen and
wither away, but that the pistil or pistils will remain,
turning at last into the ripened fruit,—the fruit which is
the end, the aim, the object, of the plant’s life.</p>

</figure>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">I should</span> like to ask each of you children to tell
me what flower you believe to be first to come in
the spring.</p>

<p>Some of you have never stopped to think about this.
But there are sure to be a few among you who will
name one special flower as the earliest of the year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span></p>

<p>Perhaps even in March you may have ventured into
the woods to look for the lovely, fragrant, waxlike
blossoms of the trailing arbutus. You know the sheltered
hollow where the snow first melts; and there the
delicate pink flowers make you glad with their beauty,
and with the thought of the good time coming. To
some of us this first hunt for the arbutus is one of the
great events of the year. It means the beginning of
long, delicious hours in the fresh air, with birds and
trees and butterflies and wild flowers as our chosen
companions.</p>

<p>But not all of you will agree that this trailing arbutus
is the first spring flower. Many think the violet can
lay claim to this honor. The yellow violet especially
may be found in the woods before the trees have put
forth their leaves.</p>

<p>And some say that the little blue liverwort (sometimes
this is pink or white) is the earliest of all; and
others vote for the spring beauty, or for the yellow
adder’s tongue, or for the Dutchman’s breeches, or for
the anemone.</p>

<p>And still others say that the marsh marigold, the
shining flower that in April gilds the wet meadows,
leads the procession.</p>

<p>But you are wrong, every one of you. The earliest
blossom of the year makes its appearance long before
any of these flowers you have mentioned.</p>

<p>The first plant to blossom knows better than to proclaim
the change of season by anything so fragile as a
violet, an anemone, a spring beauty. It sends out its
rather coarse little flowers under the protection of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
tough waterproof hood, which shields them from the
rude winds and nipping cold.</p>

<p>This plant bears the ugly name of skunk cabbage
(Fig. <a href="#204">196</a>). Its broken stem and leaves give out an
odor which at once persuades you that its title is
deserved.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp25" id="204" style="max-width: 41.1875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/204.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 196</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In the swamps the skunk cabbages send up by the
dozen the curious purple hoods which curl about the
thick clusters of little flowers. When you come across
a colony of these queer-looking objects, no wonder it
never occurs to you that the first flower
of spring is at hand. The great shiny
hoods look more like snails than like
flowers; and indeed usually the flowers
are not in sight at all, so well are they
shielded by these hood-like leaves.</p>

<p>But each little hidden flower has four
flower leaves, four stamens, and one
pistil. When they have been dusted
with pollen by fly visitors, and are preparing to turn
into fruit, the purple hoods wither away. Then the
plant sends up clusters of large bright green leaves.
In June you see these great leaves everywhere in the
wet woods.</p>

<p>So if you wish to be on hand to welcome the very
first flower of the year, you must begin to keep your
eyes open by the end of February. You must visit the
swamps each day, and look for the purple hoods inside
which are snugly hidden the little blossoms of the
skunk cabbage.</p>

<p>And I advise you now to take a sheet of paper and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
make a list of the plants as you find them in flower.
Put down the date of each blossom as it appears, and
the place where you find it. If you begin to do this as
children, and keep it up when you are older, you will
take real delight in the habit. Each year it will interest
you more and more to turn back to the old lists and
discover whether the flowers are on time, or whether
they are late or early in making their first appearance.</p>

<p>I hope your teacher will start you at once with such
a list; for the sooner you begin, the more complete will
be your pleasure in this delightful season.</p>

<h3>PUSSY WILLOWS</h3>

<figure class="figleft illowp35" id="205" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/205.jpg" alt="Pussy willows">
</figure>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Soon</span> after the skunk cabbage
has sent up its purple
hoods comes the
pussy-willow
season. But it is not
every child who has the luck to be in
the country at this time.</p>

<p>There is a clean, sweet smell in the air. Down
in the boggy meadow, just before nightfall, the
little frogs sing so loud that you wonder if they
are trying to make you believe the birds have come back.</p>

<p>The brook is getting a bright green border. The
buds on the trees are so big that you feel sure in a few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
hours they must burst open. And you know that each
new day may bring with it some happy surprise,—a
bird, a leaf, or a flower that you have not seen for many
a long month.</p>

<p>So when you find the willow branches set thick with
silken pussies, you know that a happy time has begun,
at least for you country children.</p>

<p>And even the city children learn to love these soft
pussies when they are placed in tall vases on the teacher’s
desk.</p>

<p>If you look carefully at the different branches, you
see that they bear different kinds of pussies; and
your teacher will tell you, or perhaps you will discover
yourselves, that these different branches were
broken from different trees.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp15" id="206" style="max-width: 15.3125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/206.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 197</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Do you know what each “pussy,” or tassel, is
made up of?</p>

<p>Each tassel is made up of many tiny flowers.</p>

<p>But willow flowers are built on quite a different
plan from cherry flowers. If you pick apart one of
these tassels, and examine a single blossom, you will
find it hard to believe that it is a flower at all.</p>

<p>On one branch the tassels are all golden yellow.
The flowers that make up these yellow tassels have
neither flower leaves nor pistils. Each blossom has
two stamens which are fastened to a little fringed leaf,
and nothing more. Such a flower, much magnified, is
given in the picture (Fig. <a href="#206">197</a>). The golden color comes
from the yellow pollen which has been shaken from the
dust boxes.</p>

<p>The other branch is covered with silvery green<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
tassels. Each flower in these tassels is made up of a
single pistil, which is also fastened to a little fringed
leaf (Fig. <a href="#207">198</a>).</p>

<figure class="figright illowp15" id="207" style="max-width: 18.3125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/207.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 198</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>So you see the building plan used by one kind of
pussy-willow flowers is nothing but two stamens;
while the plan used by the other kind is still
simpler, it is nothing but one pistil.</p>

<p>The golden dust is carried by the bees from
the willows which bear dust boxes to those other
willows whose flowers have only seedboxes.</p>

<p>When they have given to the bees their pollen,
the yellow tassels fade away; but the silvery
green tassels, on account of their seedboxes, grow
large and ripe, turning into the fruit shown in Fig.
<a href="#061-2">62</a>, p. <a href="#Page_61">61</a>; and this fruit is one of the kind which
scatters its seeds abroad by fastening them to silky
sails.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="ALDERS_AND_BIRCHES">ALDERS AND BIRCHES</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">There</span> is another shrub or low tree growing along
the brook’s edge which flowers almost as early as
the willows.</p>

<p>This is the alder.</p>

<p>Perhaps you noticed last fall that these alders were
hung with a quantity of little green tassels. These
tassels did not fall off with the leaves in November.
Through the long winter they clung to the shrub.
Sometimes they wore little coats of ice which made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
them look like the glass ornaments on a Christmas
tree.</p>

<p>When the warm weather came, they put off their ice
coats, and grew larger and longer,
and at last let out a quantity of
stamens.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp25" id="208-1" style="max-width: 46.1875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/208-1.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 199</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But on the same alder tree that
bears these tassels with flowers
made up of stamens or dust boxes
(Fig. <a href="#208-1">199</a>, <em>a</em>), you find also the tassels
flowers made up of pistils (Fig. <a href="#208-1">199</a>, <em>b</em>).</p>

<p>If you make a search, you will
find the little upright clusters
composed of these flowers with pistils.</p>

<p>Late in the year, when these
clusters have turned into fruit, they
look like this picture (Fig. <a href="#208-1">200</a>).</p>

<figure class="figright illowp20" id="208-2" style="max-width: 49.25em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 200</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The pretty birches are cousins
to the alders, and keep house in
much the same way, bearing the
tassels with stamens (Fig. <a href="#208-3">201</a>, <em>a</em>)
and the little clusters made up of
flowers with pistils (Fig. <a href="#208-3">201</a>, <em>b</em>) on the
same tree.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp25" id="208-3" style="max-width: 45.875em;">

</figure>

<p>The tassels on some of the birches are
very beautiful. When full grown, they are
golden yellow, and so long and soft and
graceful that one feels like stroking them
and playing with them as he would with a
kitten.</p>

<p>I hope every country child who reads<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
this book and does not already know the willows, the
alders, and the birches, will make their acquaintance
this spring, and will examine their two
kinds of flowers. And I hope that
branches from the different trees will
be brought into the city schoolroom, so
that all can see these flowers, which are
among the very earliest of the year.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Most</span> people seem surprised to learn that all kinds
of trees have flowers. In March and April they
go to the woods in search of the trailing arbutus, the
violet, the anemone; and when they have picked a
quantity of these, they come home and say, “These are
the only flowers we saw to-day.”</p>

<p>But if they had looked overhead, up into the trees,
they would have seen many more; for each tree has its
own flower, and most of the trees blossom very early in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
the year, before they put out their leaves. There is a
good reason for this, which I will tell you by and by.</p>

<p>One of the early trees to flower is the swamp
maple. In March or April its bright red blossoms
tinge the wet woods with warm color. Sometimes
the snow lies thick on the ground at this season, and
the little red flower clusters fall, and look wonderfully
pretty against the smooth white sheet
which is drawn beneath the trees.</p>

<p>At the same season, in our city parks and
streets, sharp eyes will discover the yellowish
blossoms of the silver maple. Both of these trees
flower before they leaf.</p>

<p>The building plan used by maple flowers is
rather confusing. In one flower you will find
both calyx and corolla, but not in another. One
blossom will have both stamens and
pistils, another will have no pistils.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#210-1">202</a> shows you a blossom from
the sugar maple. It has stamens, but no
pistils. Next you see what was once a flower
containing both stamens and pistils (Fig. <a href="#210-2">203</a>).
The withered stamens can still be seen; and the
pistil is turning into the well-known maple key.</p>

<p>The great elms also put out their flowers before
their leaves. Here you see a flower cluster
from the white elm (Fig. <a href="#210-3">204</a>). Fig. <a href="#210-4">205</a>
shows you one of these little flowers enlarged;
and in Fig. <a href="#211">206</a> you have the blossom cut open
so as to display its pistil, which grows into the winged
fruit you saw on p. <a href="#Page_62">62</a>.</p>

<p>In some of our city streets grows the poplar. Its
flowers are crowded into long green tassels. Many
of these fall to the pavement below, and lie there,
looking like great caterpillars. These tassels are
those which bear the flowers with stamens. Now,
if we were in the woods, we should be pretty sure
to find near by another poplar whose tassels
do not fall so quickly. This is because these are
made up of flowers with pistils. They cling to
the tree not only till they have been powdered
with pollen from the neighboring poplar, but till their
tiny seeds have had time to ripen and are ready to start
out on their life journey.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="THE_UNSEEN_VISITOR">THE UNSEEN VISITOR</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">I promised</span> to tell you why so many of the trees
flower before they leaf.</p>

<p>Many of these tree blossoms are neither bright
enough to attract the attention of the bees and butterflies,
nor so fragrant as to tempt the passing insects to visit
them; for when the flower handkerchiefs are not large
and bright enough to signal the bees, the blossom often
gives notice of its presence by a strong perfume. How,
then, is the pollen from one flower to reach the pistil of
another? And especially how can this be arranged
when the flowers with pollen may live quite a way off—on
another tree, in fact—from the flowers with pistils?</p>

<p>“Perhaps the birds carry it,” suggests some child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span></p>

<p>But if these little flowers are not beautiful enough, or
sweet-smelling enough, to please the bees and butterflies,
it is hardly probable that the birds will pay them
any attention.</p>

<p>So let us go out into the woods with our eyes and
our ears wide open, and see if we can discover some
flower visitor that does not ask for fine clothes and
sweet smells.</p>

<p>Through the bushes comes the lisp of the song sparrow.
From overhead falls the note of the bluebird.
The bees are buzzing about the golden willow tassels.
On the top of an old tree trunk a butterfly is drowsing
in the sun’s rays. But already we know that neither
bird, nor bee, nor butterfly will go out of its way to help
our pale, scentless little tree blossoms.</p>

<p>A squirrel darts from under cover, and runs along
the stone wall. Among the dead leaves at our feet a
little striped snake lies in a sluggish coil. But squirrel
and snake would be alike useless as flower visitors.</p>

<p>We are almost tempted to give up trying to guess the
answer to the riddle. Somewhat discouraged, we stop
to rest on an old log overgrown with delicate mosses.</p>

<p>A soft, sighing sound creeps through the pines at
the foot of yonder hill. Over the little hollow sweeps
a gust of wind. A faint cloud, as of dust, fills the air.
One of the children begins to sneeze. Where can the
dust come from? The roads are still deep with mud.
And, besides, ordinary dust does not make us sneeze
as though it were pepper.</p>

<p>Ah, my friend, you are getting warm, very warm
indeed; for this dust is no dried earth from the highroad.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
No, it is made up instead of golden grains from
the dust boxes that are swaying in the wind on yonder
trees. And as the trees just now are bare of leaves,
the journey of the pollen through the air is an easy
matter. It is carried along by the wind, settling here,
there, and everywhere, sometimes in our throats and
noses in such a fashion as to make us sneeze, but also
on the tops of many little pistils whose seeds cannot
ripen without its gift of new life.</p>

<p>And so, although we have not seen the visitor who
befriends these little flowers that are neither beautiful
nor fragrant, we have heard his voice as it came whispering
through the pines; and we know that this
whisper is the gentle voice of the wind.</p>

<p>Now you understand that it is well for those trees
whose flowers depend upon the wind for their pollen,
to blossom before their leaves are out, and thus likely to
interfere with the pollen in reaching its destination.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">On</span> your walks through the woods these
spring days I want you to notice the
neat and beautiful way in which
plants do their packing; for the
woods now are full of plant
packages,—little bundles of
leaves and flowers, done up
with the greatest care.</p>

<p>Some of these have just
appeared above the ground.
Others have burst from the
branches of the trees and shrubs.</p>

<p>Of course, a plant does
not like to send its young,
delicate leaves and flowers
into the cold world without wrapping them up, any
more than your mother would like to send your baby
brother out for the first time without a great deal of
just such bundling-up.</p>

<p>And so well wrapped are many of these plant babies,
that it is not an easy matter to guess just what they are,
what kinds of leaves and flowers will appear when the
wrappings have been thrown aside.</p>

<p>Sometimes the package looks like the sharp-pointed
object in the picture at the head of this chapter (Fig.
<a href="#214">207</a>). Soon the leaves push their way out of their
papery envelope, and before long our friend Jack-in-the-pulpit
himself appears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span></p>

<p>Sometimes it is such a woolly roll as you see in the
next picture (Fig. <a href="#215-2">208</a>). This roll soon uncurls
into a pretty fern (Fig. <a href="#215-3">209</a>).</p>

<p>The beech tree folds its leaves like fans
(Fig. <a href="#215-5">210</a>). The preceding picture (Fig. <a href="#215-4">211</a>)
shows you how carefully and cleverly the
hobblebush packs its young
leaves.</p>

<p>During their babyhood
many leaves wear a hairy
coat as a protection from both
cold and heat; but when their
green skin becomes thicker, they
throw this off.</p>

<p>Most of these plant packages
are very interesting and beautiful,
and well worth your attention. I wish that during
these weeks of early spring the country
schools would hold exhibitions of these
babes in the woods, asking each child
to bring what he considers a
good specimen of a plant
package.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="UNDERGROUND_STOREHOUSES">UNDERGROUND STOREHOUSES</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Long</span> ago we learned that certain plants stow away
the food which they are not fitted to use at the
time in those thick underground stems which most
people call roots.</p>

<p>This food they hold over till the next year.</p>

<p>It is often a surprise, these spring days, to see how
suddenly a little plant will burst into blossom. One
does not understand how it has had time to get up such
a display. Had it been obliged to depend for food upon
new supplies taken in by its roots and leaves, the flower
would have put off its first appearance for many a day.</p>

<p>So when a plant surprises you with any such sudden
and early blossoms, you can be pretty sure that its food
supply has been on hand all winter.</p>

<p>Both in the garden and in the woods you can see for
yourselves that this is so. In the garden perhaps the
earliest flower to appear is the lovely little snowdrop.
The snowdrop’s food is stored away in the “bulb,” as
we call its thick, underground stem, which lies buried
in the earth.</p>

<p>The other early garden flowers, such as the hyacinth,
crocus, daffodil, and tulip, are able to burst into beautiful
blossoms only because of the care and labor with
which they laid by underground provisions last year.</p>

<p>And in the woods at this season you find the yellow
adder’s tongue, spring beauty, anemone, wake-robin,
Jack-in-the-pulpit, wild ginger, and Solomon’s seal.
Each of these plants has stores of food hidden in its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
underground stem. This may take the shape of a bulb,
or a tuber, or a rootstock; but in any case it shows you
at once that it is a little storehouse of food.</p>

<p>A collection of the different kinds of underground
stems which serve as storehouses for the early-flowering
plants would be quite as interesting to work over as a
collection of plant packages.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="DIFFERENT_BUILDING_PLANS">DIFFERENT BUILDING PLANS</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">This</span> morning let us take a stroll in the woods with
the idea of noticing the different building plans
used by the early flowers.</p>

<p>First we will go to the spot where we know the trailing
arbutus is still in blossom. Pick a spray, and tell
me the plan of its flower.</p>

<p>“There is a small green cup, or calyx, cut into five
little points,” you say; “and there is a corolla made up
of five flower leaves.”</p>

<p>But stop here one moment. Is this corolla really
made up of five separate flower leaves? Are not the
flower leaves joined in a tube below? If this be so, you
must say that this corolla is five-lobed, or five-pointed,
not that it has five flower leaves.</p>

<p>“And there are ten pins with dust boxes, or stamens.”</p>

<p>Yes, that is quite right.</p>

<p>“And there is one of those pins with a seedbox below,
one pistil, that is, but the top of this pistil is divided
into five parts.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span></p>

<p>Well, then, the building plan of the trailing arbutus
runs as follows:—</p>

<p>1. Calyx.</p>

<p>2. Corolla.</p>

<p>3. Stamens.</p>

<p>4. Pistil.</p>

<p>So far, it seems the same plan as that used by the
cherry tree, yet in certain ways this plan really differs
from that of the cherry blossom. The calyx
of the cherry is not cut into separate leaves,
as is that of the arbutus; and its corolla
leaves are quite separate, while those of the
arbutus are joined in a tube.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp20" id="218" style="max-width: 26.875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/218.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 212</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The cherry blossom has more stamens than
the arbutus. Each flower has but one pistil.
But the pistil of the arbutus, unlike that of the cherry,
is five-lobed.</p>

<p>So, although the general plan used by these two
flowers is the same, it differs in important details.</p>

<p>Above you see the flower of the marsh marigold
(Fig. <a href="#218">212</a>). Its building plan is as follows:—</p>

<p>1. Flower leaves.</p>

<p>2. Stamens.</p>

<p>3. Pistils.</p>

<p>This, you remember, is something like the building
plan of the easter lily. The lily has a circle of flower
leaves in place of calyx and corolla. So has the marsh
marigold. But the lily has six flower leaves, one more
than the marsh marigold, and only six stamens, while
the marsh marigold has so many stamens that it would
tire one to count them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span></p>

<p>And the lily has but one pistil (this is tall and
slender), while the marsh marigold has many short,
thick ones, which you do not see in the picture.</p>

<p>So these two flowers use the same building plan in a
general way only. They are quite unlike in
important details.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp20" id="219-1" style="max-width: 26em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/219-1.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 213</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The pretty little liverwort and the delicate
anemone use the same building plan as the
marsh marigold. This is not strange, as all
three flowers belong to the same family.</p>

<p>The yellow adder’s tongue is another lily. It is built
on the usual lily plan:—</p>

<p>1. Six flower leaves.</p>

<p>2. Six stamens.</p>

<p>3. One pistil.</p>

<p>The wild ginger (Fig. <a href="#219-1">213</a>) uses the lily plan, inasmuch
as it has no separate calyx and corolla; but otherwise it
is quite different. It has no separate flower leaves, but
one three-pointed flower cup. It has stamens, and one
pistil which branches at its tip.</p>

<p>The next picture (Fig. <a href="#219-2">214</a>) shows you the seedbox,
cut open, of the wild ginger.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp15" id="219-2" style="max-width: 11.8125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/219-2.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 214</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>To find this flower, your eyes must be brighter than
usual. It grows close to the ground, and is usually
hidden from sight by the pair of round, woolly leaves
shooting up from the underground stem, which tastes
like ginger. This thick underground stem is the storehouse
whose stock of food makes it possible for the
plant to flower and leaf so early in the year.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#220-1">215</a> shows you the pretty wake-robin. This
is a lily. But it is unlike the lilies we already know, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
that its calyx and corolla are quite distinct,
each having three separate leaves.
It has six stamens, and one pistil with
three branches.</p>

</figure>

<p>The general building plan of the violet
(Fig. <a href="#220-2">216</a>) is the old one of calyx, corolla,
stamens, pistil. But the leaves of this calyx
(Fig. <a href="#220-7">217</a>) are put together in a curious, irregular
fashion; and the different leaves of the
corolla are not of the same shape and size
as in the cherry blossom. Then the five stamens of
the violet are usually joined about the stalk of the
pistil in a way that is quite confusing, unless you know
enough to pick them apart with a pin, when they look
like this picture you see above, to the right (Fig. <a href="#Page_220">218</a>).</p>

<p>The garden pansy (Figs. <a href="#Page_220">219</a>,
<a href="#Page_220">220</a>) is cousin to the violet. You
notice at once that it uses just the
same building plan.</p>

<p>The wild geranium (Figs. <a href="#220-7">221</a>,
<a href="#220-8">222</a>) is put together almost as
simply as the cherry blossom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span></p>

<p>A more beautiful flower than the columbine
it would be difficult to find (Fig.
<a href="#221">223</a>). Its graceful hanging head and
brilliant coloring make it a delight to the
passer-by.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp20" id="221" style="max-width: 36.5625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/221.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 223</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It has not the fragrance of some other
flowers, but for this there is a good
reason.</p>

<p>The columbine is so brightly colored that the nectar-hunting
bee can see it from a great distance.</p>

<p>It is only when a blossom is so small and faintly
colored as to be unlikely to attract the eye, that it
needs to make its presence known in some other way
than by wearing gay clothes. By giving out fragrance
it notifies the bee that material for honey making is on
hand.</p>

<p>So you see that a pale little flower with a strong
fragrance is just as able to attract the bee’s attention
as is a big flower with its bright flower handkerchiefs.
A big flower with bright flower handkerchiefs does not
need to attract the bee by its perfume.</p>

<p>Perhaps you will be somewhat surprised to learn that
this columbine uses the old plan, calyx, corolla, stamens,
pistil.</p>

<p>In the columbine the calyx as well as the corolla is
brightly and beautifully colored, and only the botanist
can tell which is which. In this way many flowers confuse
one who is only beginning their study. So you
must try to be patient when you come across a flower
whose coloring and shape make it impossible for you
to say what is calyx and what is corolla. You should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
turn both over into the one division of flower leaves,
and when older you may be able to
master the difficulty.</p>

<p>The pretty fringed polygala (Fig.
<a href="#222-1">224</a>) is one of these confusing flower.
You find it in the May woods. Its
discovery is such a delight,
that one is not apt to make
himself unhappy because
he cannot make out all its
parts.</p>

<p>The jewelweed (Fig. <a href="#222-2">225</a>),
the plant which blossoms
down by the brook in
August, is another of these puzzling blossoms.</p>

<p>It is the yellow lady’s slipper.
It lives deep in the
woods of May, perhaps part way up
the mountain side. It has several sisters.
One of these is the pink lady’s
slipper, which blossoms just a little
later. Another is the white lady’s slipper.
This comes late in June, and is one
of the loveliest of our wild flowers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span></p>

<p>These three sisters belong to a celebrated family, that
of the Orchids.</p>

<p>The Orchid family is noted for the beauty of its
flowers, and for the pains which these take to attract
the attention of the bees.</p>

<p>The building plan used by the orchids is too difficult
for you to learn yet awhile. Perhaps the orchids take
more trouble than any other flowers to have their pistils
well dusted with pollen. A good landing
place for the bee is provided; signs are
hung out to point the way to the hidden
nectar; and if directions
are followed, the pistil is
sure to receive the wished-for
pollen.</p>

<p>This picture (Fig. <a href="#223">227</a>) shows
you an orchid which you see
in the windows of flower shops
during the winter. It comes to
us from far South, not growing
out of doors in our climate.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp35" id="223" style="max-width: 59.625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/223.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 227</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Its building plan would almost serve for a wayside
tavern. You can see that the pocket would answer as
a front doorstep, making a convenient landing place
for bee or butterfly.</p>

<p>The dark spots on the upper flower leaf point downward
to the refreshment room.</p>

<p>Even more curious than this one are other orchids
which grow in far-away places.</p>

<p>In their efforts to please, they wear the most striking
colors, and take on a variety of fantastic shapes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span></p>

<p>One of them dresses itself much like a bee. In this
way perhaps it secures a visit from the real bee.</p>

<p>Another is called the baby orchid, because in the
center of each flower is an object which really looks
like a fairy baby.</p>

<p>There are some ten or twelve orchids which are common
in our Northern woods. I hope you children will
keep on the lookout for them all summer.</p>

<p>Just now you could not tell whether or not a flower
was an orchid. But if you come across a plant whose
flowers look as though they were built to serve as
wayside taverns for the bees, why, carry them to your
teacher, and ask her to find out for you whether they
belong to the Orchid family.</p>

<p>But it is only fair to tell you that some of our orchids
bear flowers so small and insignificant that you would
hardly guess them to be members of so distinguished
a family.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">On</span> this page you see a picture
of the garden foxglove.</p>

<p>The garden foxglove is an English
wild flower. It is so striking and
beautiful that it was brought across
the sea to decorate our gardens.</p>

<p>We can guess that the spots within
each bell are the signposts leading to
the refreshment room.</p>

<p>The yellow false foxglove (Fig.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
<a href="#226-1">228</a>), which grows wild in our woods in midsummer,
is a less brilliant flower than its English cousin, and
is without the spots that serve as signposts.</p>

<p>Our wood and meadow lilies (Figs. <a href="#226-2">229</a>, <a href="#226-3">230</a>) are
well fitted to secure bee visitors. Their colors
are brilliant enough to catch the eye of the most
unobserving of bees in its voyage across
the meadow, and their spots vivid enough to
lead it at once to the refreshment
room.</p>

<p>Try for yourselves to follow
these markings with
your tongue, and you will
win the bee’s reward, a sweet drop of
nectar.</p>

<p>Whenever you see a flower with
such vivid markings as these, it will
be worth your while to play the bee,
and start a honey hunt.</p>

<p>Sometimes the sweet drop lies at
the base of the flower leaves, as in the lilies; sometimes
in a pocket, as in many of the
orchids; sometimes it is in the bottom of
a long spur such as you see in the columbine,
violet, and nasturtium (Fig. <a href="#227-1">231</a>).</p>

<p>These flowers play a clever trick on
their bee visitors. They wish to make perfectly sure
that their pollen will be carried from one blossom to
another, and so they set a little trap.</p>

<p>In a freshly opened blossom each
stamen is bent over, as you see they are
bent over in the picture (Fig. <a href="#227-3">233</a>).</p>

<p>Their dust boxes are caught in little
pockets of the flower cup. When a bee
lights on a flower (Fig. <a href="#Page_227">234</a>), the jar causes
the dust boxes to spring from the pockets
with so much violence that the pollen is
shaken over the body of the visiting bee, which
is sure to leave some of
it on the pistil of the next flower.</p>

<p>Some flowers take special care

being dusted with pollen
from the dust boxes of the

<p>In Fig. <a href="#Page_227">235</a> you see that the
stamens of the fireweed are
large and ripe, and ready to
shed their pollen; but the pistil is bent sideways,
pushing its closed tip quite out of the corolla, and out
of reach of any pollen from a neighboring
stamen.</p>

<p>It is believed that those seeds which
are touched with life by pollen from
another flower are more likely to
change into healthy, hardy plants
than those which are quickened by
the pollen of their own flower.</p>

<p>Such of you as live near the sea

which make a rosy carpet across the
salt meadows early in August. The

<h3 id="FLOWERS_THAT_TURN_NIGHT_INTO_DAY">FLOWERS THAT TURN NIGHT INTO DAY</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Already</span> we have read that certain flowers attract
insects rather by their fragrance than by their
brilliancy of coloring.</p>

<p>It is interesting to learn that some blossoms open<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
usually only during the night. Of course, if these
flowers hope to receive visitors, and get their share of
pollen, they must devise some means of making known
their presence to those insects which are awake and at
work in the darkness.</p>

<p>You can understand that at night the brightest colors
would be useless. A red flower is less easily
seen in the darkness than a white or a
yellow one; so night-opening flowers
nearly always wear a white or
yellow dress.</p>

<p>And not only this: to make
sure that they will not be overlooked, and so
miss the chance of ripening their seeds, they
send out a strong fragrance as soon as the
night falls. Through the deepest gloom this
message of invitation reaches the wandering
moth.</p>

<p>Do you know the evening primrose
(Fig. <a href="#229">238</a>)? There ought to be no need
of asking you this, for it is one of our commonest
wayside plants. But perhaps you have
hardly noticed it, because ordinarily only at
night is its flower wide awake.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp25" id="229" style="max-width: 33.8125em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 238</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>When the sun has set, this pale yellow blossom unfolds,
and gives out a strong, sweet fragrance, which
means that it is “at home” to visitors.</p>

<p>After one short summer night it dies.</p>

<p>But during its little life the chances are that its invitation
has been accepted by the pretty pink moth which
oftentimes you find asleep in the faded flower cup.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span></p>

<p>The moth visitor has brought its hostess the pollen
from another blossom, and has powdered the pistil’s
four spreading tips, so that the little primrose seeds
below get the needed touch of life, and the short life
of the flower has not been in vain.</p>

<p>If you keep on the lookout, you are likely to come
across one of these yellow flowers with the sleepy pink
moth inside its cup. I have caught this little fellow
napping so often, that I have wondered if the nectar of
the evening primrose might not have the effect of a
sleeping potion. But after all, I suppose that pretty
pink moths, like boys and girls, are likely to be dull
and sleepy in the daytime if they have been up too late
the night before.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Did</span> you ever know that some plants manage to
attract insects in ways that are quite disgusting
to us human beings?</p>

<p>While spending a morning in the woods, some of you
may have noticed an odor so unpleasant that you were
driven to find another resting place.</p>

<p>Perhaps you thought that this unpleasant smell was
caused by the decaying body of some dead animal; but
had you known the truth, you would have laid the
blame where it rightly belonged.</p>

<p>And where was that, do you think?</p>

<p>Why, to that beautiful climbing plant close by, with
large, thick leaves, and clusters of pale, greenish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
flowers, that were twisting all about the bushes. This
plant it was that caused all the disturbance. It is
called the “carrion vine” on account of the carrionlike
odor of its flowers. Its pollen is carried from one little
blossom to another by tiny flies, drawn to the spot by
a smell like that of decaying flesh. These flies would
pass carelessly over the sweet-smelling carpet of the
partridge vine, they would scorn the invitation of the
evening primrose; but the odor which drives us hurriedly
from our cozy corner induces them to gather
together in hundreds. Whether they come, actually
expecting to find decaying flesh, I cannot say.</p>

<p>In some countries grows a plant which not only
smells like decaying flesh, but which adds to the deception
by its red, beefy look, thus doubly attracting the
flies which like this sort of food.</p>

<p>At first we want only

the bird which is singing overhead, or else

wild strawberries. Bird and squirrel are forgotten, for
no fruit of all the year is prettier to look at than the
wild strawberry; and, what is more important, no other
fruit has such a delicious flavor of the woods and fields.</p>

<p>Why, ever so many of you can tell me
much of the story, at any rate. It is
very nearly that of the apple and cherry
and plum and pear. The nectar-hunting bee
carried the pollen of its many stamens from
one strawberry blossom to another, leaving
some of it on the flat tips of its numerous pistils.
Down the pistils’ stalks went the tiny life
bearing tubes which pushed their way into the
little seeds below.</p>

<p>So far, the story of the strawberry is not new
to us; but just here it begins to differ from
the stories of the apple and pear, of the plum
and peach and cherry. The flowers of all these
trees had but one seedbox. But each of the
many little strawberry pistils has a separate
seedbox; and when the little seeds within get
their touch of new life, the flat, cushionlike
object (Fig. <a href="#Page_233">241</a>) which bears these many pistils
begins to act in a most surprising manner.</p>

<p>This flat flower cushion swells upward and outward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
(Fig. <a href="#233-4">242</a>), growing big and juicy and sweet, bearing
its pistils (Fig. <a href="#233-5">243</a>) with it.</p>

<p>And so in the strawberry blossom it is the flat cushion
hidden out of sight which grows into the delicious fruit.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> strawberry is a member
of the great Rose
family. Among its many
cousins we find the blackberry
and the raspberry.</p>

<p>The blackberry blossom
(Fig. <a href="#236-1">245</a>) also has five white
leaves, and a center made up
of pistils and stamens.</p>

<p>When its white flower
leaves fall, and its empty

blackberry begin to take the
place of the blossom, just as
we saw the strawberry take the
place of the strawberry blossom
(Fig. <a href="#236-2">246</a>).</p>

<p>But now we are about to
discover the way in which the
blackberry differs from the
strawberry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span></p>

<p>Cannot some boy or girl tell me in what way they are
different?</p>

<p>“One is black, and the other is red.”</p>

<p>But that is not the answer I want. Perhaps it is
hardly likely that any child could guess what I have in
mind. Still a little exercise in guessing is
as good for your brains as gymnastics are
good for your bodies.</p>

<p>Now I will tell you what this difference
is; and I want you to try and understand
it clearly, so that you will be able to explain
it to others, for I doubt if the grown-up
people could give any better answers
than you. I think your fathers and mothers will be
both surprised and pleased when you show them some
summer day how truly different are these two berries.</p>

<p>You remember that in the strawberry we saw plainly
that it was the flat flower cushion which swelled into
the ripe strawberry,—the cushion which was quite
hidden by the many pistils; and though these pistils
were scattered thickly all over the ripe, red fruit, these
little pistils with their seedboxes were too small
and dry to add flavor or richness to the berry.</p>

<p>But if we watch the growth of this blackberry,
we see that things are different.</p>

<p>We see that the pistils of this fruit do not remain
small and dry, as with the strawberry. No, indeed!
their little seedboxes grow bigger and juicier every day,
and they turn from green to red and from red to black.
They do not remain hard to the touch, but become so
soft that a slight pressure will bruise them and stain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
your fingers purple. And we enjoy eating the full-grown
blackberry (Fig. <a href="#Page_237">249</a>) because a quantity of
these juicy seedboxes are so packed upon the juicy
flower cushion that together they make
a delicious mouthful (Figs. <a href="#Page_237">247</a>, <a href="#Page_237">248</a>).</p>

<p>The flower cushion of the blackberry
is long and narrow, not broad and flat like that of the
strawberry.</p>

<p>So do not forget that in the strawberry we enjoy
eating the ripened flower cushion, while in the blackberry
the juicy seedboxes give to the fruit more of its
size and flavor than does the flower cushion.</p>

<p>Here we see a branch from
the raspberry bush (Fig. <a href="#238-1">250</a>).
How is the raspberry unlike
both strawberry and
blackberry? Let us
place side by side these

<p>Once more we observe that
the strawberry is the flat flower
cushion grown big and juicy.</p>

<p>Again we see that the seedboxes
of the blackberry packed upon the swollen flower
cushion make up much of the fruit.</p>

<p>But in the raspberry we find that the red, ripe seedboxes
alone make the berry which is so good to eat.</p>

<p>When we pick this raspberry, we find that the flower
cushion remains upon the plant, instead of coming off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
in our fingers and helping to make a luscious
morsel, as with the other two fruits (Figs. <a href="#239-1">254</a>,

<figure class="figleft illowp47" id="240" style="max-width: 39.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/240.jpg" alt="Peas">
</figure>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> Pea family is a
large one, and it is
worth our while to find out what
plan it uses in flower building.</p>

<p>Let us look at a pea blossom
and see of what parts it is made up.</p>

<p>“There is the green cup, or
calyx,” you say.</p>

<p>Yes, that is plain enough. It is
cut up into five little leaves.</p>

<p>“And there is a circle of flower
leaves, which makes the corolla.”</p>

<p>Let us pull apart both calyx
and corolla, and place the separate
leaves as in the picture
(Fig. <a href="#241-1">256</a>).</p>

<p>The five smaller leaves, the ones
marked <em>ca</em>,
are the green
of the calyx.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span></p>

<p>The five larger ones, marked <em>co</em>, belong to the corolla.
These, you notice, are not all alike. The upper one is
much the largest.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp35" id="241-1" style="max-width: 60.6875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/241-1.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 256</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The two side ones are alike.</p>

<p>In the real flower the two lower ones are joined so as
to form a little pocket.</p>

<p>And what else do you
find?</p>

<p>Now, if you do not
pull apart the pea blossom,
you find nothing
else. But you know that
the seed-holding fruit is
the object of the flower’s
life, and that so this
flower is pretty sure to
have somewhere either a
pistil with its seedbox, or
stamens with their dust
boxes, or both; for without the seeds of the seedbox,
and the pollen of the dust boxes, no fruit can result.</p>

<p>So, knowing that the pea blossom cannot
give birth to a pea pod without stamens and
pistil, let us have a search for these.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp20" id="241-2" style="max-width: 23.875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/241-2.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 257</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As I told you, the two lower leaves of the
corolla are joined so as to form a sort of pocket
(Fig. <a href="#241-2">257</a>). Now, surely, a pocket is meant to
hold something. So take a pin and slit open
this pocket. As the two sides spring apart, out
flies some golden pollen, and we see that the little pocket
is far from empty. It holds ten stamens and one pistil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span></p>

<p>If you look at these carefully (Fig. <a href="#241-1">256</a>), you see
that one stamen stands alone, while the other nine have
grown together, forming a tube which is slit down one
side. This tube clings to the lower part of the pistil.</p>

<p>Now, if you pull this tube away, what do you
see?</p>

<p>You see a little, green, oblong object, do you not
(Fig. <a href="#242-1">258</a>)?</p>

<p>And what is it? Do you not recognize it?</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp15" id="242-1" style="max-width: 21.5625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/242-1.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 258</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Why, it is a baby pea pod. Within it lie the tiny
green seeds (Fig. <a href="#242-2">259</a>) which are only waiting for the
fresh touch of life from a pollen grain to grow bigger
and bigger till they become the full-grown seeds of the
pea plant,—the peas that we find so good to
eat when they are cooked for dinner.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp25" id="242-2" style="max-width: 39.0625em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 259</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>So, after all, the building plan of the
pea blossom is nothing but the old-fashioned
one which reads</p>

<p>
1. Calyx.<br>
2. Corolla.<br>
3. Stamens.<br>
4. Pistil.<br>
</p>

<p>Had I not told you to do so, I wonder
if you would have been bright
enough to pull apart the little pocket
and discover the stamens and pistil.</p>

<p>What do you think about this?</p>

</div>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="243" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/243.jpg" alt="Clover">
</figure>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Here</span> you see the bees buzzing about the pretty
pink clover heads,—the sweet-smelling clover that
grows so thickly in the fields of early summer.</p>

<p>Can you tell me what plan the clover uses in flower
building?</p>

<p>You will not find this easy to do. Indeed, it is hardly
possible, for the clover plays you a trick which you will
not be able to discover without help.</p>

<p>You believe, do you not, that you are looking at a
single flower when you look at a clover head?</p>

<p>Well, you are doing nothing of the sort. You are
looking at a great many little clover flowers which are
so closely packed that they make the pink, sweet-scented
ball which we have been taught to call the
clover blossom.</p>

<p>It is incorrect to speak of so many flowers as one;
and whenever we say, “This is a clover blossom,” really
we ought to say, “These are clover blossoms.” We
might just as well take a lock of hair—a lock made up
of ever so many hairs—and say, “This is a hair.” Now,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
you all know it would not be correct to do this, and no
more is it correct to call a bunch of clover blossoms
“a blossom.” But as most people do not understand
this, undoubtedly the mistake will continue to be made.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#244">260</a> shows you one little flower taken out of
the ball-like clover head.</p>

<p>Can you think of any good reason why so many of
these little flowers should be crowded together in
a head?</p>

<p>What would happen if each little blossom grew
quite alone?</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp15" id="244" style="max-width: 12em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/244.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 260</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Why, it would look so small that the bee could
hardly see it. And sweetly though the whole clover
head smells, the fragrance of a single flower would
be so slight that it would hardly serve as an invitation
to step in for refreshments.</p>

<p>So it would seem that the clover plant does wisely
in making one good-sized bunch out of many tiny
flowers, for in this way the bees are persuaded to carry
their pollen from one blossom to another.</p>

<p>The moral of the clover story is this: Be very careful
before you insist that you hold in your hand or see
in the picture only one flower.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="MORE_TRICKS">MORE TRICKS</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Can</span> you think of any other flowers that deceive
us as the clover does?</p>

<p>Early in May we see in the woods a tree that is very
beautiful. It is covered with what seem to be white<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
blossoms. This tree is the flowering dogwood, and it
tricks us somewhat in the same way as does the clover;
for in this picture (Fig. <a href="#245">261</a>) you see what nearly every
one believes to be a single flower of the dogwood.
And if some time ago you had been asked to give the
building plan of the dogwood flower, you would have
been pretty sure to say that the four large white leaves
formed its corolla.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp25" id="245" style="max-width: 44.3125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/245.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 261</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Here you would have been quite mistaken; for instead
of one large flower, the picture
shows you a number of tiny
blossoms, so closely packed, and so
surrounded by the four white leaves,
that they look like only one blossom.</p>

<p>Try to get a branch from the dogwood
tree (only be sure to break it
off where it will not be missed), and
pull apart what looks so much like one large flower.</p>

<p>First pull off the four white leaves. Then you will
have left a bunch of tiny greenish blossoms. Look at
one of these through a magnifying glass. If eyes and
glass are both good, you will see a very small calyx,
a corolla made up of four little flower leaves, four mites
of stamens, and a tiny pistil,—a perfect little flower
where you never would have guessed it.</p>

<p>But all by themselves they would never be noticed:
so a number of them club together, surrounding themselves
with the showy leaves which light up our spring
woods.</p>

<p>In Fig. <a href="#246-1">262</a> you see the flower cluster of the hobblebush.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span></p>

<p>The hobblebush has still another way of attracting
attention to its blossoms. It surrounds a cluster of
those flowers which have stamens
and pistils, and so are ready to
do their proper work in the world,
with a few large blossoms
which have neither stamens
nor pistils, but which are made
up chiefly of a showy white
corolla. These striking blossoms
serve to call attention to their
smaller but more useful sisters.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp25" id="246-1" style="max-width: 48.75em;">

<p>Sometimes a whole plant
family will play this trick of
putting a quantity
of flowers in one bunch or
cluster.</p>

<p>The wild carrot (Fig. <a href="#246-2">263</a>) is one of our
commonest wayside weeds, a torment to
the farmer, but a beautiful plant
nevertheless. Each one of its lace-like
flower clusters is made up of
many flowers,—flowers which are too
small to live alone, and so have decided
to keep house together.</p>

<p>You will notice that here, as with the
hobblebush, the outer flowers are large and
more showy than the inner ones. They seem
to feel that with them rests the reputation of
the family; that they must make the most of themselves,
and do all in their power to attract the bees and butterflies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span></p>

<p>The wild carrot belongs to the Parsley family. All
the members of this family collect a great many little
flowers into one fairly large cluster.</p>

<p>Now, what is this flower which is not too shy to bring
its brightness and beauty into the very heart of the
crowded city?</p>

<p>It is the dandelion, of course. You all know, or
ought to know, this plucky little plant, which holds up
its smiling face wherever it gets a chance.</p>

<p>And now, I am sure, you will be surprised to learn
that this dandelion, which you have known and played
with all your lives, is among those mischievous flowers
which are laughing at you in their sleeves, and that
regularly it has played you its “April fool;” for, like
the dogwood and the clover, this so-called dandelion is
not a single flower.</p>

<p>No, what you call a dandelion is a bunch made up of
a great many tiny blossoms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span></p>

<p>If you pull to pieces a dandelion head, you will find
a quantity of little yellow straps. Each little strap is a
perfect flower.</p>

<p>Now, if you had been asked for the building plan of
the dandelion, you would have looked for the calyx, and
you would have thought you had found it in the green
cup which holds the yellow straps.</p>

<p>And when you were looking for the corolla, perhaps
you would have said, “Well, all these yellow things
must be the flower leaves of the corolla.”</p>

<p>But when you began your hunt for stamens and
pistils, you would have been badly puzzled; and no
wonder, for these are hidden away inside the yellow
straps, the tiny flowers of the dandelion.</p>

<p>So remember that when you cannot find the stamens
and pistils within what you take to be the single flower,
you will do well to stop and ask yourself, “Can this be
one of the plants which plays tricks, and puts a lot of
little flowers together in such a way as to make us think
that they are one big flower?”</p>

<h3 id="THE_LARGEST_PLANT_FAMILY_IN_THE_WORLD">THE LARGEST PLANT FAMILY IN
THE WORLD</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> dandelion belongs to the largest plant family in
the world. All the members of this family have
the dandelion trick of bunching together a quantity of
little flowers. From this habit the family takes its
name. It is called the “Composite” family, because with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
it, that which looks like one flower is composed of many
flowers.</p>

<p>To this great family belong some of the flowers which
you know best; and if you are not to be fooled again
and again, you must learn to tell by its blossoms whether
a plant is a member of the Composite family. This
will not be difficult if you will be patient, and pull to
pieces a few of the flower heads which I am going to
describe, and examine carefully the
building plan used by the separate
flowers.</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#249">265</a> shows you the field daisy.
This pretty flower is an old friend; and
many of you know that its beauty is no comfort
to the farmer, who finds it a sign of poor soil
and a nuisance, and does his best to get rid of it.</p>

<p>As you know, the central part of the daisy is
bright yellow, and the narrow leaves which stand
out in a circle around its yellow center are pure white.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp25" id="249" style="max-width: 41.8125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/249.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 265</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Now, if I had asked you some time ago for the building
plan of the daisy, I think you would have told me
that the arrangement of little green leaves underneath
the flower head made up the calyx, and naturally you
would have believed the white leaves above to have
formed the corolla; and the chances are that the yellow
center would have seemed to be a quantity of stamens.
As for the seed holders, you might have said, “Oh,
well! I suppose they are hidden away somewhere
among all these stamens.”</p>

<p>It would not have been at all strange or stupid if you
had answered my question in this way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span></p>

<p>I know of no plant which dresses up its flowers more
cleverly, and cheats the public more successfully, than
this innocent-looking daisy; for not only does it deceive
boys and girls, but many of the
grown-up people who love
flowers, and who think they
know something about them,
never guess how they have been fooled
the daisy. Indeed, some of them
will hardly believe you when you tell
them that when they pick what they call a daisy,
they pick not one, but a great many flowers; and
they are still more surprised when they learn that
not only the yellow center of the daisy is composed of a
quantity of little tube-shaped blossoms, but that what
they take to be a circle of narrow white flower leaves is
really a circle of flowers, each white strap being a
separate blossom.</p>

<p>I dare not try to tell you how many separate blossoms
you would find if you picked to pieces a daisy and
counted all its flowers,—all the yellow ones in the
center, and all the white outside ones,—but you would
find a surprisingly large number.</p>

<p>The picture above (Fig. <a href="#250-1">266</a>) shows you a daisy cut in
two, and next you have one of the white outer flowers
(Fig. <a href="#250-2">267</a>). This flower, as we must call it, has a pistil,
but no stamens. The pollen is brought by flies from
the yellow central flowers to this pistil.</p>

<p>If you children once make yourselves well acquainted
with the make-up of the daisy, seeing with your own
bright eyes (not believing it just because I tell you it is
so) that there are many little flowers where most people
think they see only one big one, you will never forget
it as long as you live; and you will know something
that many of the big people about you do not know.
Some day while walking across the fields I think you will
enjoy surprising them by pulling to pieces a daisy, and
explaining to them this favorite flower trick.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Along</span> the roadsides, in the month of May, grows a
flower which you children call a blue daisy. This
has the yellow center of the
field daisy; but the narrow
outer flowers which surround
the yellow center are
not white, they are blue.</p>

<p>The real name of this
flower is “robin’s plantain.”
It is not a daisy, though it
belongs to the same big
family. Here, too, the yellow center is
made up of many little tube-shaped flowers.</p>

<p>Later in the year the fields are white and
purple with beautiful asters (Fig. <a href="#251">269</a>). It is easy to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
see that these asters are
own cousins to robin’s
plantain. Their flower heads
are put together in the same
way, and many of the asters wear
the same blue or purple dress
(Fig. <a href="#251">269</a>).</p>

<p>When once you have become
acquainted with the
secret of dandelion and
daisy and aster and robin’s plantain,
you will find it quite easy to discover
their little separate
flowers. All these plants
have large, plain flower
heads that you cannot mistake.</p>

<p>But with some members of this great
Composite family you are going to have more
trouble, unless you take your time and keep your
wits about you.</p>

</figure>

<p>Just when the asters begin to border the roadsides in
the month of August, the golden-rod (Fig. <a href="#252-1">270</a>) hangs
out its bright yellow flowers. This golden-rod is one of
the plants which you may find a little troublesome; for
its little flowers are so tiny, that even when a number
of them are fastened together in a bunch, the whole
bunch looks like a very small blossom (Fig. <a href="#252-2">271</a>).</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp10" id="252-3" style="max-width: 12.5625em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 272</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In each of these little bunches or heads (for when a
number of flowers are packed together in this way, we
call the whole bunch a “head”) there are a few of the
strap flowers (Fig. <a href="#252-3">272</a>) on the outside, and a few tube<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
flowers (Fig. <a href="#253">273</a>) in the center; but the outer strap
flowers are so small that you can hardly believe they
are really flowers, and the tube flowers look hardly
larger than ordinary stamens. To see them at all
clearly, you must use a good magnifying glass.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp10" id="253" style="max-width: 13.0625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/253.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs80"><span class="smcap">Fig. 273</span></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>And you must search very patiently for the tiny
bunch (Fig. <a href="#252-2">271</a>) which is the head of the golden-rod.
Next you must pick to pieces this little head, separating
the outer from the inner flowers.</p>

<p>In hunting for a single head in this great yellow
flower cluster, you must look for the little cup-like
arrangement, the tiny greenish or yellowish leaves; for
each head is held in one of these small cups.</p>

<p>Although the golden-rod is one of the most difficult
of all the flowers to understand, once you have seen for
yourselves how each little head is held in its tiny cup,
you will find it easy enough to pick out its single
flowers, and then you will have mastered the secret of
the golden-rod.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">We</span> found, you remember,
that the dandelion head
was made up entirely of strap
flowers; and we saw that the
daisy and aster and golden-rod were
made up partly of strap flowers, and
partly of tube flowers.</p>

<p>And here you have a great thistle
head (Fig. <a href="#254-2">274</a>). If you
should pull it to pieces, you would find
only tube flowers.</p>

<p>The Composite family always makes
up its head in one of these three ways,
using either nothing but strap flowers, or
nothing but tube flowers, or else using tube
flowers for the center of the head, and strap
flowers for the outside.</p>

<p>Now, I hope you will remember these three ways in
which this important family puts together its little flowers.</p>

<p>When you go into the garden where a big sunflower
(Fig. <a href="#255-1">275</a>) is trying to peep into your neighbor’s
yard, I hope your eyes will be
sharp enough to see that this sunflower
is a cousin to the field daisy,
and that, although its brown center
is much larger than the daisy’s
golden eyes, it is made up of tube
flowers (Fig. <a href="#255-2">276</a>) shaped much
like the tube flowers of the daisy.</p>

<p>And you will notice, I am sure,
that the yellow circle about this brown center is
made up of strap flowers (Fig. <a href="#255-3">277</a>) just like the
circle about the daisy center.</p>

</figure>

<p>And what is that which falls like a golden shower
from the great brown center of the sunflower? Ah,
you know well that that is the precious pollen which
powders thickly the visiting bees and butterflies, and
goes to make new sunflower plants.</p>

<p>The picture at the head of this chapter shows the
wild sister of the garden sunflower.</p>

<p>When you come across the bright blue flower of
the chicory, you will be reminded, I hope, of your
dear old friend the dandelion; for the chicory head,
like that of the dandelion, is made up entirely of
strap flowers.</p>

<p>But when you pick a spray of everlasting, whose
white and yellow clusters you find on the rocky hillsides,
you will have to use your eyes with great care
if you are to discover that here, as in the great purple
thistle head, are nothing but tube flowers.</p>

</figure>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">In</span> fact, if you are to see any
of the things that are really
worth seeing, you must study the
art of using your eyes. You must <em>learn
to see</em>.</p>

<p>This world is full of things that are
beautiful and interesting, things that do
not cost money, that can be had
for the seeing.</p>

<p>School is nearly over now, and
during the weeks that lie before
you there will be many hours which you children can
call your own.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span></p>

<p>I wonder what you will do with these holiday
hours?</p>

<p>Of course, you will play a great deal; at least, I
hope you will, for we need play almost as much as we
need work. But one does not play every minute, even
in the holidays. I hope that all of you will spend a
part of your holidays in trying to be a little useful to
your mothers.</p>

<p>But even then there will be some time left for other
things,—things that are not work, and that are not
exactly play, yet that are a little of each, and so perhaps
better than either play or work alone.</p>

<p>Among these “other things” I hope “learning to
see” will find its place. I wish that every child who
reads this book would make a resolution that during
these coming holiday weeks he will “learn to see.”</p>

<p>There are many different ways of doing this. The
children in the city can learn this great lesson as well
as those who live in the country. There is much to be
seen in the city besides people and houses, and horses
and wagons. There are the clouds of the sky by day,
and its stars by night. There are the trees in the
squares, the birds and flowers in the parks, and much
besides.</p>

<p>The children who live by the sea do not have the
great forest trees that grow among the mountains; but
for this loss they can comfort themselves by the beautiful
rose mallows (see the picture at the head of this
chapter) that grow in the marsh, by the sea pinks along
the creek, by the pretty shells and seaweeds on the
beach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span></p>

<p>But perhaps you think I am quite wrong in taking it
for granted that you need to “learn to see.” What
gives me the idea that you ought to learn any such
lesson?</p>

<p>Well, nine times out of ten, if I hand a flower to a
child and ask him to look at it and then to tell me about
it, he will stare at it, oh, very hard indeed, for some
moments, and then he will have nothing to say.</p>

<p>Now, this cannot be the fault of the flower; for we
have seen that the flower is made up of so many different
things that to tell about them all takes some time.
It must be the fault of the child; or at least the fault of
his eyes and brain, both of which are needed for really
seeing, and which probably he does not know how to use.</p>

<p>It must be that he has never “learned to see.” Perhaps
he has used his eyes well enough, and has really
seen a great many things in the flower; but his brain
may not be able to put them together in the right way,
and to find the words that are needed.</p>

<p>If this is the only trouble, a little practice will make
it all right. He will find that his brain works better
after each trial, just as a new pair of scissors works
better after it has been used several times.</p>

<p>But often the eyes do not seem to do their share of
the work; and if they do not, there is no chance for the
brain to come to their help.</p>

<p>That is a sad state of affairs, because, if when we are
young we let our eyes form bad habits, such as not
seeing the things they ought to see, we are likely to be
half blind all the rest of our lives.</p>

<p>It would be a terrible thing, would it not, to be told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
that you were about to become blind, that soon you
would be unable to see the things about you?</p>

<p>Now, while I trust that none of you will ever become
altogether blind, I tell you honestly, I greatly fear that
some of you are in danger of becoming partly so,—of
becoming blind to many of the things about you that
would please you greatly if you only saw them. And I
know that this sort of blindness must take from your
lives much happiness.</p>

<p>But still you may wonder how I know this about
children whom I have never seen. How can I know
whether the boys and girls who read this are in any
danger of losing their power to see?</p>

<p>Well, the only way I know about you boys and girls,
whom I have never seen, is by watching very carefully
the ones I do see.</p>

<p>You children who live in New York, say, have never
seen the children who live in California; yet you feel
sure that they have eyes and ears just as you have, do
you not?</p>

<p>And you are pretty confident that most of them like
to play far better than they like to work; that sometimes
they are good-natured, and that again they are
quarrelsome; and that in many ways they are like the
boys and girls who live near you.</p>

<p>In just the same way I am able to guess that you
children whom I do not know are more or less like the
ones I do know.</p>

<p>Now, among these children only a few, as I have
said before, seem to have the full use of their eyes.
This troubles me, because the evil is one that grows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
greater as the children grow older. Perhaps you know
that if you stop using any part of your body, that part
soon begins to lose its power of doing the things it was
meant to do.</p>

<p>If you should not use your legs for a long time, they
would grow so weak that they could hardly carry you.
It would be much as if you had no legs, or at least as
if you had legs that could not do the work they were
meant to do.</p>

<p>If you stopped using your hands, you would find
your fingers growing stiffer and stiffer, so that at last
they could not take a good hold of things.</p>

<p>And if your eyes are not used for seeing clearly the
things before them, they will grow less and less able to
see clearly.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="A_COUNTRY_ROAD">A COUNTRY ROAD</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">I have</span> taken a walk along a country road which
was bright with flowers of many kinds, where lovely-colored
butterflies and buzzing bees were hard at work
hunting for sweet stuff, where birds were singing in the
trees as they watched their nests, where a rabbit would
dart from the bushes close by, and a squirrel would scold
at me from overhead,—where, in short, there was so
much to look at and delight in, that I could hardly make
up my mind to keep on to my journey’s end, instead of
stopping to see if I knew the names of all the flowers,
to admire the queer, bright-colored little patterns on the
wing of the butterfly which was resting on a neighboring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
blossom, and to find out what sort of eggs were in
the nest that I knew must be near at hand, for the
mother bird let out her secret by her frightened clucking.</p>

<p>Well, I have taken just such a walk; and on going
into the house I have felt as if I were obliged to put
aside a book of enchanting fairy stories, or rather as if
I were turning my back on fairyland itself, with all its
wonderful sights and sounds and adventures.</p>

<p>And then what has happened?</p>

<p>Why, some child (it has not always been a child) has
come in, and I have said, “Was not that a fine walk?
What did you see along that lovely road?”</p>

<p>Now, if he was a boy (for I want to be quite fair), he
probably had seen the rabbit and given it chase; and it
is more than likely that he had stopped long enough to
chuck a stone at the squirrel; and if the mother bird
had not finished with her foolish chatter, I fear he gave
her some evil moments by hunting for her nest, with no
good intentions. But if, fortunately for them, he had
met none of these creatures, he probably looked at
me in surprise, and answered by look, if not by words,
“No, I thought it a long, stupid walk. I did not see
a thing.”</p>

<p>And if it was a girl, I fear the answer, silent or
spoken, was much the same.</p>

<p>Now, I say that boy or girl must have been partly
blind to have missed seeing those wonderful flowers,
and butterflies, and bees, and birds, and many other interesting
things which I have not time here to tell
about. Certainly they were not using their eyes properly;
and the longer they go about in such a way,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
more worthy of a bat than of a well-made child, the
more useless and bat-like will their eyes become.</p>

<p>It is really more natural for a child to use his eyes
constantly than it is for an older person. The grown-up
man or woman is likely to have so many things to think
about, that eyes and brain do not always work together,
and so the surroundings are not noticed.</p>

<p>For every boy knows that if his head is full of the
ball game he is going to play, he runs along without
eyes or thoughts for other things.</p>

<p>And every girl knows that if she is on her way to
some friend to whom she has a secret to tell, she is in
such haste to reach her journey’s end, and is so busy
thinking what her friend will have to say about it all,
that of course there is no time to pay attention to anything
else. Her eyes may be in good working order,
yet they are not of much use unless her brain is ready
to help them; and that little brain just now is too
busy with its secret.</p>

<p>No, by the people who are half blind I mean only
those who much of the time use neither eyes nor brain,
who can neither tell you what they have seen nor what
they have been thinking about. Sometimes it seems as
if such people were not only half blind, it seems as if
they were only half alive.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="A_HOLIDAY_LESSON">A HOLIDAY LESSON</h3>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">But</span> I am in hopes that some of the children who
read this book will say, “I do not think it fair to
call children half blind and only half alive. I know I
am not half blind. I saw all those things that Mrs.
Dana saw along that country road, and” (perhaps some
of them may add) “a good deal more too. I know all
the different flowers by sight, and the sunny hollows
where the first ones come. I know where ever so many
of the birds build their nests, and how their different
eggs are marked and colored. Often I go down to the
little pool in the woods where they come for their bath.
I know how the caterpillars wrap themselves in leaves
and come out beautiful butterflies. I have peeped into
the hollow of the tree where the red squirrel is bringing
up its family; and I have seen how the pretty green
katydid scrapes his wings along his sides, and makes
the sound, ‘Katy did, Katy didn’t,’ and oh, so many
more things that I have not time to tell them all.”</p>

<p>Ah! that is just it. The child that knows how to use
his eyes can see so much, so many wonderful things!</p>

<p>That is why I am so anxious that he or she should
not miss through carelessness the revelations that come
to the child alone.</p>

<p>It seems as though the woods and fields were more
ready to tell their stories, to whisper their secrets, to
children than to grown people. If people learn to use
their eyes and ears only after they are grown, I hardly
think that they will ever read quite the same stories,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
ever listen to quite such wonderful secrets, as if they
had begun to look and to listen when they were little
children.</p>

<p>If fairy godmothers came now, as the stories tell us
they did once upon a time, to the christenings of our
little ones, offering whatever gifts the parents should
choose, it seems to me one of the wisest selections would
be the power <em>to see</em>.</p>

<p>And so when I ask you children, now that you are
putting by your lesson books for many weeks, to learn
one lesson this holiday time,—to <em>learn to see</em>,—I am
asking you to do something that will make your lives
far happier than they could be were this lesson left
unlearned.</p>
